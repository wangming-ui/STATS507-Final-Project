"Nightclub rating only...\n\nWe got lucky because we happened to arrive during Kris Humphries' (new husband of Kim Kardashian) bachelor party.\n\nI also saw Jordan Farmar, Lamar Odom and Scott.\n\nPlace was packed on a Saturday night and we didn't want to wait in line so we did bottle service. Cost us $575 total for 5 guys and we got grey goose and our choose of drinks.\n\nYou don't get your own VIP booth - you actually get to sit on a long couch and you get a small section along with the other bottle service people.\n\nOverall pretty cool club, but I think it's pretty small compared to others like XS, Marquee, JET, and Pure.",1,1
"Absolutely atrocious service, while there were only three tables of customers at 7pm on a Saturday night.  To top it off, the waiter was a smart ass when, after 15 minutes of his being MIA, we inquired as to his whereabouts when we wished to order more drinks & food.  On the plus side, the food was fine and arrived quickly (even before the chips and salsa appetizer?).",0,1
"Worst customer service ever.  While some things that went wrong were out of their control, this so called \""""business\"""" was completely unprepared.  It was obvious you were trying to increase your margins by cutting corners to cut costs across the board.  1ns did not tender the service which everyone paid for.  Johnathan's excuse for basically making eveyone's weekend uncomfortable and unstable, \""""It's our first time doing this.\"""" This business is a joke.  Not only that, when we get on the bus for the trip back to LA, eveyone was offered a $50 refund for transportation.  Then when he found out they got a charter bus, he took the paper back and said nevermind...WTF is that? If anything I should be refunded for the multiple nights I had to pay to get back from EDC. your ONE yellow shuttle was no where to be found.  Everyone also basically lost their whole friday because the shitty fucking bus broke down. Also was made to look like a fool when I go to TAO Beach when it opens only to be told they've never heard of 1nsgroup.  They might have been fixed after, but it was still embarrassing.  SO MANY OTHER THINGS that I haven't mentioned.  Please fellow people who went through hell because of 1ns, add whatever I forgot below.  I plan to report them to the according consumer bureaus.",0,0
"L.A. people are so spoiled with wonderful sushi restaurants at nearly every corner - I'm one of those people. But I have to say that Roka Akor has blown most of the L.A. sushi restaurants I've been to out of the water. I don't always rate the restaurants I eat at for various reasons, but I couldn't wait to rate this restaurant. You'll see why...read on please.\n\nRoka Akor is rated as one of the Top 10 sushi restaurants in the U.S. by Bon Appetit, so with that rating plus being from L.A., we were definitely expecting a lot. We were welcomed warmly, seated promptly at the best seat at the sushi bar, and given our menus. We took a gander, and were kind of shocked at the minimal selection of rolls on their menu. (Of course this didn't matter later once we tasted their food - everything is excellent. Don't let this disappoint you, it's excellent food.) A few minutes later, I noticed another couple seated a few seats away from us. Their waitress attended to them right away, and we still hadn't been attended to at that point, so I was immediately pissed off and ready to walk out of the restaurant. My friends who know me well, know that this action would have been true to form. I'm nice, but I'm accustomed to excellent service at all types of establishments. When I don't get it, I get pissed off - that's just who I am and I don't think I'm the only one.\n\nI digress...\n\nI'm glad my husband kept me seated to give the waiter a chance to come over and take our order because I ended up really enjoying myself...and the food obviously. We had a sampler of Shochu drinks, which are these delicious infused drinks. Our favorite was the Fuji Apple flavor, although all of them were good. At the same time we were served our appetizer - the Butterfish Tataki with white asparagus yuzu. (Incidentally, the Fuji Apple Shochu really brought out the flavors of the Butterfish Tataki.) Usually butterfish has a muddled flavor - I think that's just the nature of that fish, but their preparation of this fish really cleaned it up. It exploded with flavor - very delicious.\n\nWe also ordered the Hamachi Serrano Chili Maki. This roll has very clean flavors - I enjoyed it very much. Next came the Roka Sushi selection, which are 4 different types of sushi selected by the chef. My only qualm here is that one of the four nigiri given was something we also had a full order of (the Salmon Goma Nigiri). Nonetheless, all of it was good. After that came the full order of Salmon Goma nigiri we ordered, which was sooooooo SO good. My husband usually doesn't like salmon because he thinks it's too fishy, while I ordinarily love salmon. We both loved loved loved this. It was so excellent. I would definitely order it again. Finally, we received the kobe beef, which was also very good. Perfectly cooked medium rare and lots of flavor. It comes with mushrooms which added a great dynamic flavor to the meat, and this yummy creamy sauce in which to dip the meat. Delicious. For dessert, we had the Green Tea Custard. We ordered this mostly out of curiosity. Who's ever heard of a Green Tea flavored custard? It did not disappoint. Light & airy, this custard really impressed us. I only wish I had the black cod because it looked so yummy and other yelpers have raved about it, but oh well. Maybe next time.\n\nAfter the meal, our server apologized for the delay we experienced earlier in the evening. I really appreciated and respected that. It was definitely a good move on his part, and he got a good tip out of it. Later, though, I thought that if they were really sorry they could have comp'd part of our meal. So here's how I came up with the score:\n\n5 for the food, knowledgeable wait staff and nice ambiance\nminus 2 for the huge f*ck up early in the evening\nplus 2 for the apology\nminus 1 for not comping part of our meal\n= 4 (if we could rate in half points, I'd probably give them 3 1/2)\n\nFinal thought: I don't know why we didn't get approached by the wait staff as quickly as the other couple who was seated after us, but I don't believe that people should keep quiet about stuff like that. When you pay for anything at any amount, you should be given the best service possible and if not, the establishments should expect to deal with the consequences for their actions. So, keep it up Yelpers! Use your consumer power!!",1,1
"Great double date place that allowed us to bring our dogs to sit at the table outside with us. Although it took a long time to get a table, the beer made up for it. As well as the BBQ chicken. The Sunday special will have me coming back for only the chicken and cornbread. \nDownside was the service, and when we were advertised the BBQ buffet, we ordered seconds and got \""""the last of it,so enjoy\"""". And no chicken. \nGood atmosphere.",1,1
"This was the worst service EVER. Especially with Melissa at the counter.\n\nI called 3 times before going down there to make sure that I had everything  I needed  to rent the car. I walked down to their office and had all the paperwork they asked me for and my DEBIT card, which they said they accepted. I showed up and had to wait for her to finish her conversation about going out the night before before she helped me. When she finally turned around and asked how she could help me, I gave her my driver's license and my card and she turns to me and says sorry we can't rent to you using this card, gives me back my card, and turns around to continue talking to her coworker. She did not even tell me why we could not use my card or any other card. I have a credit card, I have other debit cards, but she did not even bother asking me if I wanted to use another card, instead, she just turned around, and continued gossiping. Even if she would have said sorry, can't take this card, do you have another? I would have been ok with it but she was too busy with more 'important' matters. Rude and no way to keep customers. \n\nI left there and just rented at Enterprise. Yes, they were a little bit more, but honestly, it is worth the extra amount if anything just for their service.\n\nWill never make another reservation with them, no matter how good of a deal it is.",0,0
"I was waiting for my friend to show up for a concert across the street, and decided to get a quick bite to eat. I always see this place and decided why not. \n\nBig mistake. I walked in and sat at the counter. I had to ask for the counter to be cleaned/wiped, and still ended up wiping it again myself after they finished. Then it took a few minutes before i was greeted. After placing my order, I waited and waited. \n\nOnce the order came, that was the final disappointment. The home fries, were under-cooked. I asked for cheese on them, and they added a few sprinkles of finely shredded cheddar. They barely let the cheese melt. The sausage was ok.  The bacon was 2 teeny weenie strips that appeared to be under-cooked also. \n\nOverall disappointing experience!",0,0

I was looking forward to this dish, but that burgundy red wine mustard is just nasty and overpowering), pass!\n\n- Sea Scallops Gratinees (caramelized fennel & onion marmalade, mussel cream) - thin scallops that were tasty, but surrounded by too much cheese.  Should have gone with the entree version instead, sigh...\n\n- Rack of Lamb Special - overpowering mustard sauce on the lamb that was just unpleasant.  The lamb was tender and the au jus was tasty.  Excise the sauce and it is  tasty, but $36 worth of tasty?  No.\n\n- Creme Brulee - this was the best dish of the night, nice and creamy with the right thickness to the sugary top.",0,1

"Jade Palace is a great little gem tucked away in a strip mall near Pinnacle Peak Rd. and Scottsdale Rd.\n\nI recently binged on a bunch of delicious dishes here as a pre-diet feast.  The place was packed with sliver-haired snow birds.  There was some cougar action at the bar which I always love to watch, but now that i think of it, it was more of a Hugh Hefner and his 24 year old bride-to-be action.  I was actually the only cougar there. :)\n\nI digress.  \n\n3 Delicacies is great.  Tender flank steak with tender scallops and tender shrimp.  Crab puffs were awesome and light and flaky but creamy and lovely in the middle.  Fried rice is excellent and they don't skimp on meat if you choose to order it with chicken.  And the chicken was tender.  Generous portions. Again, everything is lovely, yummy, fresh, tender, and most importantly, NOT TOO GREASY, which we all know is the signature of Chinese food. And my Absolut Press was poured in generous manner. :)\n\nIf you are looking for crappy food don't go here.  If you are looking to meet men, go here but expect them to all be over 65. If you are looking to meet younger men and have crappy food, go to Sapporo.",1,0

"If I could, I guess I would go with 4 1/2 stars? \n\nI came to Vegas for my best friend and my birthday.  We wanted to go to a nice restaurant and ultimately selected RM Seafood.\n\nFirst, 3 out of 4 of us are Top Chef fans and were excited to meet Rick Moonen and chat with him.  He's a very nice man and we talked about the food.  He spent a lot of time on the floor...only thing about that that concerns me is that I know he's a celebrity chef and all, but I hope he had a hand in the food that night.\n\nTwo of us did the prix fixe and two of us didn't.  We ate:\n\nAppetizers:\n-California roll with real crab (mine)\n-Steak tartare with fries\n-Ahi Tuna two ways\n\nMy california roll was better than a typical california roll (with fake crab), but none the less it was a ...california roll. The steak tartare looked excellent and I was told that and the tuna both were.\n\nMain course:\n-Lemon-butter scallops and shrimp with capers\n-Halibut with basil sauce\n-Cioppino (mine)\n\nAll three were delicious!  The halibut was the best...love the clean flavors...the green.  Scallops were seared to perfection.  The cioppino was the weakest of a very strong pool.\n\nDessert:\n-16 flavor ice cream challenge\n-Key lime pie\n\nWe were so full by the time we got to dessert, but hey, how many more times am I going to come?  We had to do the ice cream challenge! We got about 10 correct.  According to the waiter, the average correct is 8.  This was more about the experience as some of the ice cream flavors were truly disgusting.  haha.  We had a great time though.\n\nThe waiter also brought out a little candle with the ice cream for our birthdays! (They didn't sing, which I wouldn't expect or want in a joint like this so it was just right. :) )\n\nI'm not usually a key lime pie fan, but this one was probably the best key lime pie I've ever had.  \n\nThe bill wasn't as unreasonable as some of the other restaurants in Vegas (we also didn't drink though).\n\nAll in all, it was a great experience and perfect low-key moment to a crazed Vegas trip.  I would recommend this restaurant to a seafood loving fan looking for a good, not-outrageously priced but still nice meal for their Las Vegas trip.",1,0

"I came here with my boyfriend's family (who are Mauritian) on a Sunday night for his mom's birthday dinner. The decor is decent, nothing too outstanding.\n\nAlthough the place was only 1/3 full, it took the waiters awhile to acknowledge us. Five minutes of waiting around later, we were finally seated, without menus. I had to go over to another table where they were all set on and picked up some. A waiter finally came over to bring us water and although we asked for utensils, as only chopsticks are offered on the tables, he walked away with them in hand instead of giving them to us. He finally came back to bring them to us, and took our order. \n\nWe ordered the seafood soup, crab balls (YUM), beef & Chinese broccoli, crispy chicken, chow fun with black bean sauce, chicken chow mein, shrimp fried rice, Cantonese-style lobster and just regular steamed rice. We had asked to have the crispy chicken and steamed rice served simultaneously, but the waiter got all in a huff and said he can only bring things out as they are ready from the kitchen. \n\nOur food started to trickle out slowly but surely, and here is what I thought;\n- The crab balls, although were pretty tasty, were a lot smaller than say at Kam Fung (for 3$ a piece you'd think they'd offer a little more sustenance).\n- The beef & Chinese broccoli was pretty good, although the meat could've been less tendon-y. Good flavouring though.\n- The crispy chicken was a let-down; it was pretty dry, and didn't taste too fresh.\n- The chow fun with black bean sauce was pretty delicious; it was my first time having it and I enjoyed it.\n- I have nothing but good things to say about the chicken chow mein; it had a good mix of crispy noodles and fully cooked ones. And the veggies weren't soggy as they sometimes end up being. \n- The shrimp fried rice was pretty good, mind you they were pretty cheap with the shrimp; they sprinkled maybe 10 mini shrimp throughout the whole dish.\n\nI don't eat lobster, and didn't have any seafood soup, so I can't critique those.\n\nI was really hoping to get the lentil soup for dessert (soooo good), but, and I know this is stereotypical, I have a feeling because I was at the table (I'm Caucasian, and my boyfriend's family, as I mentioned is Chinese-Mauritian) the waiter brought orange slices and fortune cookies. \n\nSo all in all, it was ok, but I will stick with my tried and true Kam Fung.",0,0

Yes, I ate, but I was terrified that everyone would be sitting on a toilet for the rest of the night and that we would be totally unable to paddle our races the next day.\n\nMicrowavable edamame was my friend since I saw the costco sized bags sitting on the side (I figured I'd be safe with these), and I attempted to try everything else like the random seafoods, mushy sushi, and fatty meats. Their desserts were weird generic cakes that seemed to be salvaged from the sale section of the local grocery bakery, so I stuck with the frozen yogurt.\n\nLots of better options out there, but I guess since there were about 50 of us, we were limited.",0,0
"I had the distinct pleasure of making the acquaintance of the King of our fair city earlier this week. At his behest, we met up at The Skeptical Chymist.\n\nAt first glance, I was nervous that the venue would be incredibly small. It's tucked away in the corner of a shopping center, between a sandwich shop and a Rubio's. The storefront is immensely wide, but for some reason, it didn't appear that it would be very spacious inside.\n\nTo say that I was wrong would be putting it lightly. When I walked up to the \""""Please Seat Yourself\"""" sign where a hostess might stand during peak hours, I was immediately lost. There was a vast section in the center of the bar that was teeming with people there to enjoy the amazing happy hour specials (from 4:00 pm - 7:00 pm). I had to actually walk around to the right side of this group (through a small seated dining section) to reach the bar.\n\nI only had a moment to gaze at the bar while waiting for Scott D. to arrive. In that time, I noticed several different beers with which I am, sadly, not yet familiar. Though, after the night I enjoyed, I'm sure we will not be strangers for very long.\n\nWhen Scott D. arrived, we ordered a nice stout beer (I'm ashamed to say that I was too nervous to pay attention to the name of the ale). Scott said that it's a good idea to \""""start from the left, and work your way to the right\"""" of the beers on tap. On this night, we never made it past the first tap.\n\nWe picked up our ales, and headed to the outdoor patio (another pleasant surprise).  The patio was surrounded by misters, which I'm sure, offer great relief during the blistering summer months. There was a television in the corner of the patio that was airing the Thursday night NFL game. There was a walk up bar that connected to the bar in the main room. \n\nAt first, it appeared that we got lost in the mix, as it took a while before a waiter came around to see how we were doing. But, once they realized their mistake, they were exceptionally quick to rectify the situation. Our server, whose name escapes me, was incredibly courteous and apologetic for the delay. He asked if we were interested in appetizers...which, after the strong ale, we absolutely were!\n\nScott recommended the \""""Pulled Pork Sliders\"""". Perhaps it was the beer, perhaps it was the situation. But the sliders were great! They come four to a plate (perfect for sharing). And since it was happy hour, we got them at half price ($5.00).\n\nAs the night progressed, there was another round of the same beer. That, subsequently, led to another appetizer. For this round, Scott suggested the Chicken Tenders. Being happy hour, we only paid $4.50 for this dish. Just like before, this dish comes with four chicken tenders, making for another easy mathematical conclusion as to which way the dish should be split. I know they were chicken, but the manner in which these tenders are fried, they reminded me more of fried fish. Whatever the case may be, they were scrumptious.\n\nCue the third round of beers, again from the same tap. (Now I HAVE to return, just so I can figure out what this beer is called!) \n\nWe sat, we drank, we ate, and we were merry. We ended up chatting for more than three hours over drinks and bar fare. So, if you were paying attention, you know that we each had three stout ales and two delicious appetizers during our little pow wow. \n\nBy the time the tab came, I had completely forgotten that we had been drinking and dining on Happy Hour prices. The damage was an astounding $40.00...including a generous tip! \n\nAs we exited the bar (three plus hours later), it dawned on me that there was a stage upon which live music acts performed! This place is WAY bigger than I had originally though!  \n\nAnd did I mention the \""""Library\""""? I fear I may have said too much already...perhaps when I return, I'll venture into the rest of the nooks and crannies of this local gem!\n\nThat wraps it up for my 50th review. I know, to some, 50 reviews isn't an impressive milestone. But, to me, this one was special. And, after all, everybody has to start somewhere!\n\nI hope you enjoy both the review and the venue!",1,0

"This was truly a major-league disappointment.\nI am a huge fan of the horror genre, and have a great respect for Eli Roth. I took a group of friends to the Goretorium, and I was very excited.\nThis is a classic example of a chain only being as strong as it's weakest link. I had the very highest of hopes, and even gave an extra star based on the money someone clearly poured into this venture. But sadly, it was all soured by the customer service. Yes, the weakest link was the staff. And they were so flippant, and so sarcastically sweet in the way they went about trivializing our experience, that I felt compelled to write this review. It's really too bad, because behind the staff that is ultimately going to be their costly demise, I'm sure there is a well intentioned group of visionaries that will always wonder what happened to their brilliant and well executed idea. Unfortunately, Las Vegas is a customer service driven destination, and to survive here, they are going to need to learn that, quickly. Hopefully, they read these reviews, and learn from them.\nAs such, it is with a heavy heart that I issue 2 stars.\nI do however hope that they get their act together, since this has the potential of being a great addition to Las Vegas. \nI will try them again in a month or so, and re-review.",0,0

"If you are looking for a cheap buffet and/or want an introduction to classic American home cooking, then the Garden Court Buffet at the Main Street Station is for you.  The buffet is only $9 for dinner ($8 if you join their player's club) and offers a whole array of American classics, from fried chicken to roast beef and manicotti, to pork shoulder and make-your-own-tacos.  There are also pasta salads, mashed and baked potatoes, green beans, steamed carrots, etc.  The only thing really missing are ribs.  The casino seems attract Filipino/Hawaiians, so there were a few Chinese/Filipino/Hawaiian offerings as well.\n\nWe weren't too hungry so we didn't taste that many dishes, but the manapua (Hawaiian steamed pork buns) were the best I've tasted.  The pork had the perfect combination of acid and sweetness and they kept very well in the steam table.  I wholeheartedly recommend this.  The other winner are the mashed potatoes.  They are perfectly seasoned and taste just of what they are.  The kalua pork was also pretty good, but as the main flavor in this dish is liquid smoke, it's hard to get it wrong.\n\nOther dishes weren't as great.  My daughters enjoyed the \""""make your own tacos\"""" station and I liked the tortilla chips, but the guacamole needed more avocado.  The fried chicken was crispy, but it tasted like the microwavable kind.  The lumpia and chow mein both needed more seasoning.  My husband liked the pasta salad (or was it potato salad?), but it wasn't cold enough.\n\nThe biggest loser of the day was the mac & cheese  I didn't taste it, but my daughter could barely stomach one bite - and this is not a picky child.  The other loser was the melon, which was unripe and not sweet.\n\nDesserts were the best part.  Their banana cream pie was particularly tasty, but their key lime pie wasn't bad - though too sour.  The cheesecake was great, if a bit sweet.  Everyone's favorite, of course, was the soft-serve station.  There are many other choices, however: from pies to pastries to puddings.\n\nService was great, our waiter refilled our glasses often.\n\nIn all, it was a very pleasant experience.",1,1

Had them move me a few days ago for the second time in two years. Both times were amazing. I went with them due to affordable price and family recommended.  They were spot on both times with flawless service. I didn't get the owner either time but his 3 man crew both times were friendly and quick and didn't harm our brand new home. clearly the only person who didn't give 5 stars so far is the competition or had a miscommunication on their end...because I got multiple followup calls and confirmations.,1,1
"Walked in on a Friday night... Thought we may not get in since we didn't make a reservation.  It was pretty empty, then we found out why.  Appetizer- $13ish  3 crackers, 3 slices of cheese, 3 slices of summer sausage.  Was decent, not decent enough for $13.  The three of us were starving and looking for a good meal.  We were warned by our server that portions were small and to order more if hunger was to be quenched.  (Hence the reason to go EAT?)  Second portion: Salad.  We ordered two kale salads and one that  basically had Cracker Jack popcorn thrown in.  (At least hers had a \""""little\"""" more flavor)  We spent $33+ on three salads that had about as much taste as a wafer on Sunday at church!?!  Ours was HORRIBLY bland.  Best aspect of it was the one slice of tomato at the bottom.  It was actually very tasty.  We were about to turn our napkins in and call it a night at Cork and head elsewhere.  But we had high hopes... Course #3: Wagyu flank steak for me, the special of the evening for the lil lady, Pork loin with apricot and mozzarella something-or-other, and our friends Lamb dish.  My steak was flavorful and I don't have much to gripe about... The lamb eating friend tried fervently to cut through her rubbery portion, only to eat 3-4 bites and give up.  As for the lil lady:  The \""""special\"""" was not so special, unless being dry as cardboard makes one feel \""""special\""""?  I could see it from where I sat... flakes of pork flinging off as she cut, not moist tender-bites of goodness that sounded appetizing from our server. \n\nService was good, polite, attentive, food was less than ridiculously bland and WAAAY overpriced for NOTHING good!?!  Sad...and I was embarrassed since I recommended we go there.\n\nSo, we ate a $15 pizza afterwards.  That fulfilled our needs.",0,0
"The non-sushi items were pretty impressive! I had a white fish taco that was absolutely delicious! The decor is pretty and the mood is very nice. I would like RA to bring down their happy hour prices-they are rather steep, and I don't appreciate the fact that they have 75 cents tagged on each price...it seems like an advertisement ploy to get you to think you're only paying $2, but in reality, you're almost paying $3. The sushi was not impressive-in the past, I heard that the cuts at RA were much bigger, but the sushi I had today was thin-more rice than tuna. The California roll fell short on size, flavor, and plating, and I had to go and ask for wasabi and ginger because none was given to us with our sushi. The ginger was also quite potent-more than the wasabi as far as heat. I wish it was pickled just a little longer. Please fix it RA! You're a pretty cool place!",0,0
"We visited this little restaurant last week and it was great! It is a family owned business and everyone working was super nice and eager to please.

While waiting for our takeout I saw a plate of spaghetti and meatballs go by and it looks amazing, something I will have to try next time. The only cons would be that it lacks in decor and is very small, but something that is easy to get over since the food is outstanding. It is also very clean (which is a must) so if you are looking for a casual place to grab dinner, or just to get takeout, please give this place a chance!",1,0
"I really hate having to write a bad review, but my visit to this location warrants this.\n\nFirst, I'll talk about the food. Overly priced, the portions were small, our biscuits were hard, and in general for the price, it did not seem worth it. The restaurant was almost empty, but it still took a long time for everything to come out. And we didn't order anything \""""well done\"""" or anything that would be a reason for it to be so slow.\n\nService - Our server was nice and informative. But I saw him so busy running food to other tables, refilling drinks for other tables, even bussing other tables, it was hard to get his attention, when we needed things. I don't fault the server for this, it just seems unfortunate that a restaurant gives so many duties for a server when all they should be doing is working on customer service. \n\nMost likely won't be back. I tried the Green Valley location a few years ago and enjoyed it, but this one wasn't up to par unfortunately",0,0

"I'm not sure where to really start to review this place.\n\nIt is in a great location at Town Square, so it could be a good place to stop in if you were shopping there or going tothe movies there. It has kinda cool decor...sort of a rock n' roll theme with guitars on the wall and photos of people like Taylor Swift & Bon Jovi. The bar has lots of TVs for sports, too.\n\nWe went in the afternoon, so it was really dead, which made me feel like the service should have been fantastic, but it wasn't. Our sever, Danielle, seemed to be stoned out of her mind. She talked really really slow, and said things like \""""restauarants are in my genetic make up\"""" and \""""I can make recommendations 'cause I work here\"""". She was nice enough, but there was visible dirt under her fingernails and she kept leaning all over the table to make her aforementioned recommendations...which kinda grossed me out.\n\nThe food and drinks took FOREVER which, again, I couldn't understand since were were practically the only people there. We ended up ordering 2 appetizers (pulled pork sliders & cheeseburger sliders) and sharing. Both were served with french fries that were ICE COLD. The sliders were pretty good, but nothing spectacular.\n\nIt took forever to get the check, and the bill came to over $30 for only the 2 appetizers, an iced tea, and a soda. So, in my opinion, WAY over priced!\n\nI can pretty much say with certainty, I won't be back.",0,0
"I wanted to take my grandma out for some dinner and since this place is a block or so from her house, we decided to give it a try. \n\nUpon arriving we could tell that it was busy, but there were still empty tables. We waited for 5 to 10 minutes to be seated and then another few for our waitress to take our drink orders (water, nothing from the bar). At this point I should have taken better notice of the patrons around us. Nobody had food in front of them and several tables looked anxious as if they had been waiting for some time. Our waitress returned to take our orders and then we started what would be the longest wait in restaurant history...\n\nWe literally waited for 35 minutes from the time we placed our order to the time we received our dinner salads. 'Oh good sign' I thought as we received our salads, thinking dinner couldn't be too far behind... well I was wrong. We sat and sat and sat for another 25 minutes. Eventually I told my hard of hearing grandma that I was going to settle up on our waters and side salads and we would go grab some Arby's. She agreed and I hunted down our waitress. When I told her I wanted to tab out, she looked at me with disbelief and stated she would have to get the manager. Then she proceeded to clean a table. I was disgusted and ready to go. And I would have too, if my sweet little grandma wasn't sitting there. Our waitress returned and asked if we could wait 2 more minutes. I looked around and mentioned there were at least 2 other tables ahead of us. She stated that they ordered pizza and it takes longer than our orders. A few more minutes passed and our plates came out. \n\nThe food was nothing fancy, but did taste alright. I had stuffed shells and grandma had manicotti. \n\nNext time I take grandma to dinner we will make the drive to another place and avoid the excessive waits.",0,0

"First time here with my baby for a date night dinner. The server was really nice and the services is really good. I wasn't really happy with the steak, I'm sure the chef can do better than what I can cook at home. I ask for medium rare. And the steak come out bloody rare with no flavor at all. I was really disappointed with the steak. I normally go to Mon abi gabi at Paris. And the steak have soo much flavor and cook the way I wanted. Lucky my gf order some lobster, so I ate the steak with lobster at the same time so I won't give up on the steak so fast. But then I find a hair on the lobster. That just Kill dinner. I work 10 hours today. Didn't eat anything all day. I'm saving my belly for this dinner. Wasn't really happy about it. So the manager come over and he did his job well. He said he won't charge us for the mistake they make. But what make me write this review because I was so piss when I saw the bills. I feel like I'm being rib off.

We can escort you.\"""" That instantly shut me up because the guys are already in there waiting with no chance of a refund. The promoter and the guy in charge of the promoter line knew they had gotten us. SO we were led in with bad attitudes and our buzzes gone. \nSO because of this tragedy I will never go there again and warn my friends from going there.  Yes the inside is cool, but that does not excuse their behavior.",0,0
"This place was AMAZING. Up until I went to Stripsteak my favorite steak place was Cut by Wolfgang puck. But, given that everything here was amazing (the appetizers, main meal, sides AND desert) it is an overall winner and now at the top of my list. I'm just sad that it is in Vegas and not in LA. Also - I figured it was about $200 less than Cut for the same meal / alcohol combo. Be sure to get the donuts with dipping sauce at the end of the night!",1,1
"I normally don't do buffets but this one is fantastic! For around $25 at dinner, you have items to chose from like, king crab, prime rib, pesto mashed potatoes and sushi! There is a salad bar, soups, various fish entrees, Asian, Indian, Italian and American foods. Plus everything is good! I think I tried a little of everything! :( The dessert bar has a good selection of yummies like tirimisu,cheesecake and tarts. They are all presented really nice with chocolate \""""B's\"""", for Bellagio of course. Not all buffets are good on the strip so BUYER BEWARE. Spend the extra $5 per person to go to the Bellagio, it is WELL worth the extra cash.",1,1
"Came in last night for my birthday. The place was packed with a waiting line but we had reservations for our party. Steve, our waiter, was amazing and handled our group of 7 adults with swift precision and courtesy. Everyone in our party was impressed with their appetizers & entre's. It was a great experience. Members of our party also kept commenting favorably about the \""""Old Las Vegas\"""" selection of music classics by Martin, Sinatra, etc. A lot of food so plan on a to-go box.",1,1
"Annie's has many of the makings of a high end restaurant such as the prices and ambiance, besides that, it is sorely lacking. My girlfriend and I were seated immediately with the restaurant fairly busy. We were both surprised at how nice the interior was; dimly lit with old photos of the owners in their 1950s prime. It was very nice and felt welcoming.\n\nThen the problems started. It took at least 12-15 minutes for our waiter to come by (granted, someone came by to say he'd be by \""""soon\"""" and that they were very busy), but when he did, he walked up, said hello and introduced himself, then he went to go check to see if we were his table, then came back and said he'd be back in a minute and went five feet away to a table that had been seated after us and took their drink orders. It was absolutely ridiculous. Almost laughable. We didn't order drinks solely for that reason.\n\nWhen he finally did come by, we just wanted to order and eat since we were starving. Following that, it was another 15 minutes of waiting before we got bread (we had to ask). I ordered the chicken parmigiano and my girlfriend ordered the potato gnocci. The gnocci was great and being as famished as I was, I was so excited to eat my meal, only to be completely let down. The first bite of the chicken I spit out. I don't do that, but I had to. It was this chewy, rubbery texture that I thought was fat. It turned out the entire chicken was pretty much the same consistency. We deduced that it was a really cheap cut of chicken. At least it wasn't under cooked (which I thought it was at first). Regardless, it was almost inedible. Oh and $7 to split the check? Not that we needed to, but good god that's ridiculous. \n\nI just moved to town and I really wanted to like Annie's, but I saw little charm or reason to ever visit again despite the decor, which, unfortunately, you cannot eat.\n\nOne star is harsh, but I think in our case, it is completely warranted. If anyone had eaten the chicken I did or waited the length we did for literally anything that a restaurant should do as soon as you sit down, you would think the same.",0,0

We need more restaurants downtown though.\n\nThus, I decided to stop in and try their breakfast today. They just opened yesterday and I was surprised to see that it was packed! Since I was by myself, they sat me at the bar where I had a perfect view of the kitchen, and the hustle and bustle going on. I had the eggs with sausage and potatoes and they were delish! \n\nI am so happy that there is another option for food in the downtown area.",1,0
"This cafe is really quaint, and quiet. The atmosphere is very welcoming. There isn't many places to sit when it's busy, but there is some outdoor seating for nicer weather. It's located near where I live, and the food is pretty satisfying. Their sandwiches use waffles as their bread. I never would have thought that it would taste so good! I got a regular waffle with strawberries, banana, whipped cream and chocolate sauce. Pretty typical desert waffle. Nothing out of the ordinary, but the waffles were really crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside and not too sweet. Exactly what a waffle should be. We'll be returning here for sure.",1,1

"I have came here a few times and I think it's time to have an overall opinion of this place.\n\nFood 4 stars\nThey just made some changes to the menu, which is quite extensive for a BBQ joint.  Their wings are among my favorites (if not THE favorite). They are big and meaty and grilled. And even better, 6 for $5 (or 50 cents each on late night bar menu). Buffalo was good but I like the chipotle apricot best.  The chili is different; it was made with chunk of meats... More sweet than savory but still awesome for a cold night. The bacon devil eggs are easy to be consumed: open mouth, pop one in.  They can fill it up a little more but it is an appetizer. And the newest addition to the app menu is the giant hush puppies.  And they are good... Honey butter makes it even better. \nThe kitchen that started Macs is behind this joint.  While I was never a big fan of macs, I am pleased by this place.  Their smoked chicken is moist (I had dark meat). Brisket is a thick slice type.  My only suggestion is for the sauce to be toned down a little since they do have sauces to be used at table.  Some side items are lacking in the wow factor, but then I am a tough judge on Mac and cheese (and onion rings were a little bland too). I do LOVE the corn, which tastes even better the next day.  \n\nService 3 stars\nWhile I never had bad services here, I find the waitresses to be a little lacking in enthusiasm. On my first visit I was asking for input on what to order, which I think for a newer joint like this, a convincing (and honest) suggestion from the wait staff can go a long way.  Same with beer suggestion. People, this place has a beer selection!  Again, the bartender has always been ok, but an extra wow factor can make a difference. \n\nLocation/Atmosphere 3.5 stars\nThis used to be levacchia. Inside space arrangement hasnt changed much. Making it a little nicer and bigger than what you think a BBQ joint should be.  It is huge frankly.  It is right next to the light rail stop.  They validate parking which is great for arena events. \n\nA little disclaimer: I met the owners, who invited a few people to taste the new menu.  Is my review skewed because of it.  Never. But I learned a few things about the place and felt the heart they put into everything.  And it makes me want to see this place strives. I mean, they actually promise they will always have the Panthers games on, with volume!\n\nCome and try them out.\nBudget conscious alert: 3 words. LATE NIGHT MENU. 2 more words. DRINK SPECIALS. After 9 or 9:30pm. I know y'all are not in bed yet.  Oh wait, 2 more words. FREE PARKING!",1,1
"Service was good. I ordered the jack Daniels burger, which I had before. My wife ordered the basaltmic chicken salad, and my four year old daughter ordered the Mac n cheese. We had the shirmp cocktail as an appetizer. The shirmp cocktail was not good as the shrimps were kinda soggy. My burger was much smaller than my previous visits, flavor was good. When the plate came, I mostly saw empty plate. I mean if they are going to make the burgers smaller, at least fill the rest of the plate with French fries.mi think maybe there were fifteen total fries, maybe a half a potatoe worth.  My daughters Mac n cheese was much smaller than before. About a half of a cup of Mac n cheese. My wife's salad was lettuce and a half breast worth of chicken. After 70 dollars later, we left hungry. First time I didn't take to go boxes home. Don't go to TGIF if your hungry. I understand portion sizes are always too big, but cut the price down, and when I go out to eat I like to feel full.",0,1

"I've been riding on Mallard/Clarks Creek Greenway for several months now. I'm new to cycling and figured that this would be a good learning point before dealing with traffic on the open road. Plus it's one of the only Greenways in this area that is longer than 2 miles one way. \nThe paved section is around 10miles (out and back) so you can get a decent \""""newbie\"""" ride. I like and don't like how it winds behind housing developments. It's nice to see what the Jones' are up to but also kind of creepy thinking that you may be watched. The route is a good workout with some small, slight climbs and turns. Parts of it is uphill a little bit (mostly heading back from Saxonbury way). There is a lot of activity during the warmer days. Plenty of dog walkers and other fellow bikers. \nParking at the Elementary School can be limited, especially if going around 2 o'clock and the uphill climb is brutal when you are returning to your car. There is also parking along Saxonbury way which is very accessible and if you're eager for more, then you can ride throughout the neighborhood too. \nThe trail is decently maintained but I think that may have to do with the budget cuts in Charlotte. You will definitely find better maintained Greenways in the counties north of Charlotte (i.e. Davidson and Cabarrus). The main issue with this is dodging sticks and debris after a storm the night before and also navigating across the bridges. I'm afraid of losing a tire over some of them with their gnarly, knotty wood. It would be nice if they had water fountains and Doggie Depots along the greenway but I may just be spoiled from Cabarrus County. \nYou can easily make this a 12miler by adding the University Research trail and the Kirk Farm Fields trail. I will say that if you have a Road bike then it may be an uncomfortable and unstable ride through the research park as it's loose gravel/rock. However, if you are on a Hybrid bike or MB then you will do just fine. I particularly love the Research trail route for the scenery along the creek. It reminds me of a winding forrest trail in the mountains.",1,1
"Roger was Aaaaaamazing! He was great, sweet, and definitely a confidence booster. He transformed my hair into a beauty. The staff was courteous and patient. The decor was very stylish.

"Being the airport of Las Vegas I guess I expected a little bit more from this arport. I love the idea of having slots in the terminals for that last ditch effort to cash in a big win, but really there is not much else to this airport.\n\nOne good thing is that the airport offers free wifi. That's pretty much it.\n\nFood is pretty sparse from my experience. A lot of the service desks were shut down and people were just kind of huddled everywhere because there wasn't much room. It's just kind of a dank room you're in. I know airports aren't glitzy, but this place could use a good scrub down.\n\nMaybe they want the airport to be as seedy as the reputation of it's strip has?

The bacon blended perfectly with the sirloin patty.\n\nRising Sun- 4.5/5- This burger is an amazing combination of kobe beef with tempura avocado.

The service was awesome - we had a really nice waiter and a couple other people checking on us through out the night. \n\nThe menu is designed for sharing - which I love to do, so my friend and I ordered a several dishes. We each had a salad. I had the Chicory Salad (hazelnuts, roasted squash, endive, and desert honey-chestnut buttermilk). It's not that often that I go crazy about a salad, but this one was exceptionally delicious. I loved the roasted squash and the dressing had a very slight spicy undertone (cayenne?) that was so good. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. My friend had the Baby Lettuce Salad (avocado, fennel, orange-pomegranate vinaigrette) which was very good, but she was jealous of mine. \n\nWe shared the finger sandwiches (brie, honey, walnuts); fries and gravy (parsnips & potatoes with melted gruyere and a mushroom gravy dipping sauce); the mac and cheese. All were good, but I'd probably only order the mac and cheese again.\n\nAll this with a glass of wine made for a pretty great meal. I'm excited to go back!",1,1
"I was nervous before showing up here because of all the horror stories I had read online about being ripped off or lowballed when selling a car to them but Amelinda L assured me that I would have a positive experience and provided me with her contact, Joe Memolo. \n\nNote: This review only reflects my experience in selling a vehicle to them as I have not purchased or serviced any vehicles here.\n\nJoe was really nice and walked me through the process even when knowing that I was not going to buy a vehicle from him on the same day. Even though he was busy completing a sale, he met up with me to discuss my car and put it in to start the appraisal process before returning to the customer he had been meeting with. I waited for about 15-20 min before he returned and told me that my appraisal had been completed. Wow that was fast! We then went over the appraisal on his computer, which included the CarFax report, and despite a couple of issues found that I was unaware of, I couldn't believe the offer because it was higher than I had expected! He then printed the written offer from CarMax and informed me that I had 7 days to decide. I told him that I would accept it on the spot and had my title with me.\n\nJoe then walked me over to the business office where I met with a buyer to complete the contract, titling and other paperwork. I also had a chance to clean out my car and they removed the license plates for me. This phase took about 30-40 min. I was pleased and pleasantly surprised at how smooth the process was. Never was there any lag time, stress, confusion or changes to the written offer they had given me. \n\nOnce everything was completed I was given copies of all paperwork signed and my check for the sale and I was out the door! Joe stopped back by halfway through the paperwork process to check on me which was great to see. Nothing could have made the process any smoother and I was in and out the door in less than 90 min. I would recommend Joe Memolo to anyone looking to do business with CarMax and I will be back to see him next time I need to buy/sell a car at Carmax",1,1

As we were all waiting several other parties were seated and their drink orders and food orders were taken immediately before the 7 tables that were already waiting.\n\nThe waitress today was the most clueless I've ever seen.

She would ask someone for their drink order and go get one ice water and not bring back the other tables drink order that she had already taken.\n\nThe worst problem was after a LONG wait for our food she brought them out and walked right past our table and I noticed it was our order. However, she walked it over to a table with seven people and asked them who had the \""""fried rice and sweet and sour chicken?\"""". They all told her they didn't belong to that table yet she sat the meals down in the middle of their table and walked away. They all started looking at one another wondering why the heck she left them there and she was walking past our table I said \""""I think those were our meals\"""" and she went over and picked them up and brought them to us and didn't say a word. We never got a refill on our drinks, we didn't get the spice tray or sweet and sour sauce we asked for.\n\nThe food tasted totally different and was not the same recipe they normally use. The food was cold when it came out and had no flavor at all. My fried rice looked like white rice with some broccoli and onions in it and wasn't fried at all.\n\nFirst time in my life I didn't tip a waitress. If I ever go back and see that same waitress I will turn around and walk out. This was not the Asian waitresses that normally work there, this one looked Hispanic and she was terrible. She was so bad the cooks in the kitchen were taking orders and running food and drinks because she could not keep up.",0,0
"I wont be back here again,  Ever.    Can one give less that 1 star? \n\nIt is a bummer as I used to frequent this place as it is conveniently located for me.  Pamela the bartender is a sweetheart and works hard to recognize people by name.   Personalized service like hers helped me to overlook issues like the significant cleanliness challenges that are easy to spot if you look around.   If you think I am joking go into the bar and look up a the light fixtures.   That fuzzy stuff is probably 10+ years of dust.  Carpets are dingy and smells like old beer.  This place rocks as a nightclub on weekends I dont think that cleanliness is the priority......anyhow....I spent a lot of money there over the years, mainly for lunch or after work cocktails with friends.  Never more..... not because of the issues outlined above, but it is beacuse how I was treated when visiting the establishment not long ago.   Pamela was not working that day (sadly) and the male bartender decided that he was more interested in lecturing me on his beliefs than he was in serving my drinks and taking my money.  He had an issue, and apparently I was the target and cause of his rantings.   He was sad about the lack of customers and decided it was my fault as I mentioned I worked downtown.   His rants about downtown businesses was unorthodox and uncalled for.   I drank my beer and hurried out reminding myself never to set foot in the place again.  No wonder they are lacking for customers.    There are more and more restaurants downtown.  Time to step it up or get out of the way Matador!",0,0
Probably not a destination you would visit unless you worked here or wanted to have a business meeting and thats the kind of people you run into here.  Beautiful business people.  I met a friend just to check out the baked goods and try the coffee.\n\nIt's really a full dining experience with a breakfast and lunch menu that look delicious.  I got to spy some of the lunch items heading out for catering and they looked fab!\n\nCoffee and baked goods were good but I think I spent as much in parking fees as I did in coffee.\n\nStaff is probably the only questionable factor here.  Manager was correcting them loudly in eating area which seemed very unprofessional.  Good workers are hard to find.\n\nThanks Romancing you do a great job!,1,1

"Is it possible to give a place lower than a 1 star on Yelp ? Seriously, this place needs it.\n\nLocated in an old strip mall on the east side of town, the outside actually looks nice, once you fight your way through the door it all seems to go down hill from there.\n\nAs the only people in the place it was surprising to be ignored, a request for a table for 6 took us to a table for 4...Yep, this is how it would be....\n\nNow I should say, we have eaten here before, but my mother in law grabbed a groupon for the place so the choice was taken out of my hands.....\n\nMenus delivered, a whole two of them for the 6 people....\n\nFood and drinks ordered...then nothing, for 30 minutes we sat, nobody to check on drink refills etc.\n\nTo the food. Descriptions taken from their menu :\n\nVeggie Pakoras, Mixed vegititables in a special batter. fried to a crispy brown, by which they mean a mixture of onions...I actually love Chicken Pakoras, the batter was ok, but seriously, if you are going to offer a mixture of vegetables, actually serve a mixture.\n\nBack to being ignored for another 20 minutes.\n\nMixed Tandoori Combo,  Mixed Tandoori Combo seekh kabob,Chicken tikka boti,Chicken Tandoori (Two), actually not bad, the seekh kabob was probably the best thing I ate there.\n\nChicken Handi, Pieces of chicken cooked in a butter flavored cream sauce, a not so good version of buttered chicken.\n\nShrimp masala, not listed on the one line menu, but if you know Indian you can figure it out...Blah, pretty much blah.\n\nA couple of orders of plain nan and garlic nan, actually the second best thing behind the seekh.\n\nMeal finish, time to be ignored again...seriously do these people have no idea on how to run a restaurant ? If you leave the floor unattended for 20-30 minutes at a time, with the door jammed open, people will walk out, not pay bill, get fed up and leave...\n\nSo with a little bit of work the food could be ok, the service..well there is none so it doesn't apply.\n\nIf you're looking for a good Indian meal try Everest or India Masala.",0,0

"I booked a room at the 69th St, Scottsdale, AZ location for the 26th & 27th of November. My wife's parents are in a nursing home a few miles from there and we wanted to make and take them a homemade Thanksgiving dinner. I choose this property due to proximity and the advertised kitchen with full sized refrigerator. I even called ahead to request a ground floor room and confirm a full sized refrigerator and was assured that was what I was going to get. Upon check in the person behind the counter told us we were on the 2nd floor. I explained that we requested and confirmed a ground room floor. His response was that no we had a 2nd room floor. When we got to the room we noticed a very small dorm room sized fridge and a very small microwave. I talked with the front desk about this problem but they offered no solution. Because of the effort we used to haul all of our stuff up to the room we decided to utilize an ice chest we brought for the lack of refrigerator space and try to make best with what we were given. The exhaust fan in the bathroom did not work and the odors escaping into the kitchen forced us to go and buy some spray. Once we started to cook the meal I noticed that the front burner on the stove did not work. Because of the time urgency I was forced to remove, clean and adjust the burner to make it work. After the water started boiling I noticed a brownish colored liquid that was dripping from the hood. I looked underneath and found that it looked like it had never been cleaned and we were getting a mix of condensation and old grease from previous visitors. In the middle of the night the toilet stopped flushing and then, due to the paper thin walls, the neighbors kept us awake til 2 am. The bug screen on the window was shot but only fitted in with all of the other run down and extreme lack of cleaning and maintenance that the rest of the room had. This was my first and last time at an Extended Stay America.  This place is a prime candidate for Hotel Impossible. Beyond disappointed!",0,0
"Granted it's a dive campus bar but been frequenting them for half price burgers on Tuesday. Food was pretty good, loved the Mac and cheese as an upgrade.

Needless to say we won't be back anytime soon.",0,0
"This is 3.5 for me.  Things got off to a great start.  Love the way the bar is decorated because I felt like I was on an episode of Gilligan's Island.  The booths are covered in little tiki huts and very comfy -- a must if you plan on staying for the length of a game.  The service was fast and friendly.  Then the smoke set in.  Get mad all you want smokers, but I firmly believe you should be forced to smoke outside or shamed into quitting.  I don't care what you do to yourself, but I have never smoked.  That is MY right and I will not be made to marinate in a smoky haze while trying to enjoy a beer and some nachos.  I already have to endure a smoke-filled office during the day (thanks boss), and I refuse to deal with the same on my off time.  \n\nNow that I am off my soap box, if not for the smoke, I would be a constant here.  The food was better than average for bar food, happy hour prices are very cheap, the girls who work here are very pretty and most guys dig that.  The food standouts were the crazy big nachos (although next time I would get the cheese sauce on the side because it was overwhelming) and the chicken tenders.  I think single guys would enjoy this place for the eye candy and single girls would enjoy this place for the dating opportunities.  Tons of big screens so you won't need to worry about missing the game.  Sadly, I will probably stay with BWW since it is smoke-free, but if you do not have the same concerns, I highy recommend this place.",1,1
"I will never set foot in this store ever again after today.  About three weeks ago I brought my bike to them after a friend suggested the store to fix a warped chain that was extremely annoying.  Upon inspection from the guys, the gears were also wearing very poorly because of the warped chain, so they suggested to replace those too.  I figured why not, might as well get the whole assembly fixed up nice.  They needed to order one part, which would take about a week.  The following Thursday I get a phone call that the part was in and I immediately brought my bike to the shop for them to fix and I left it with them.  Before I left, I asked about how long they thought it would take to fix it.  I was told they would try to get to it on Friday, and if not I'd have it early next week.\n\nGreat!  I'm all excited, it's just gonna suck to have to walk everywhere for a few days, but it'll be worth it.  So 4th of July weekend comes and goes, didn't get my bike on Friday, (Monday was the 4th) Tuesday, or Wednesday.  So on Thursday, I call and they tell me that they've been very busy and backed up and shorthanded and they didn't come in over the holiday weekend to work.  He can't give me an exact update other than there are only 3 bikes ahead of mine.  No call Thursday.  On Friday I call again.  It's now a week after they told me I should expect my bike.  They inform me that they should be getting to it that day.  Low and behold, late afternoon I get a phone call that it's ready.  At 5 after work, I go and pick it up.  I pay them and I ride home without a problem.  \n\nYesterday, I rode to work without a problem.  When I went home last night, the gears started skipping.  I wasn't having this problem before they fixed the bike though, so I was very confused.  This morning, I'm on my way to work, just pulling out of my street onto Neglley and the gears skipped in the middle of the road.  I also got hit!!  Scared the hell out of me.  A normal 10 minute bike ride took close to 20 minutes because I couldn't get proper power out of my bike.\n\nToday at 11, when the shop opened, I was their first customer.  I brought the bike in and the tech took a look at the chain and said one of the links was busted.  The chain is 4 days old.  So he fixed it free of charge by just replacing the broken link.  Either way, I don't like the fact that a chain broke so easily.  I paid over $120 for them to keep my bike for a week and for me to have to go back a few days later because something they replaced had already broke.\n\nLike I said at the top, I'll never go back...",0,0

"They weren't friendly and almost everything I tried to order had some rule that prevented me from getting the quantity I preferred. Every meat seemed to be styled from a different city (Kansas City brisket, Memphis pulled pork, St.louis ribs, etc.) so the place really didn't have it's own identity. The sides looked good but really lacked flavor. For example, the potato salad looked fabulous but really didn't taste like anything; the macaroni and cheese tasted like butter I guess. The biggest problem was the way they presented the meat. I ordered a three meat plate and they poured sauce on everything (NOT a good sign) and basically scrunched all three meats into a bowl. The brisket was thin and chewy, basically no smoked flavor. It also had cracks in it, so I guess they don't cut to order (either that are they are really doing something wrong). The ribs looked promising, but again they were chewy and no smoked flavor. The pork had slightly more flavor and the texture seemed right but the sauce was inappropriate (pulled pork typically has a thin vinegar sauce on the side, not BBQ sauce on top). Honestly, I didn't finish it and as much as I hate to waste food I threw at least half of it away.",0,0

"This was the best meal we had in Vegas, by far. Maybe it was because we tried to go to 2 other places prior that were either closed or had a long wait and we were just hungry, but I'm going to venture that it was actually just that good.\n\nThe hostess seated us semi-promptly by Vegas standards and they had a pretty full house. Our waiter was friendly, engaged us in conversation (but not too much), and was willing to give suggestions.\n\nFirst of all, I have to gush about the olive tapenade they serve with the bread basket - OMG! As a lover of all things olive, I would go back just for this. \n\nI started off with a tropical martini concoction. I can't even remember what was in it (pineapple juice?), but it was really yummy and had the perfected sugar rim. But it was also $14. Yikes.\n\nSince we were starving (it was 11 pm our 'home' time), we ordered the prosciutto and fig flatbread. It was simply delicious. It had whole figs, and COVERED in prosciutto. Toppings tended to fall off as you took a bite, but it was still delicious.\n\nI had the Chicken and Gnocchi and it was really good. The chicken wasn't as well prepared as the gnocchi and sauce, but overall it was really good. The downside was the flatbread was so large and the olive spreads were so good, I was full by time I got my entree.\n\nOne thing I will say is a downside is it is a little pricey for what we got - 1 flatbread, 2 pasta entrees (one with sausage and mine had chicken), and a drink each and it was nearly $150 with tax and tip.",1,0
"My friends and I had a poor first experience at Rx Boiler Room last night. We arrived around 10:15pm looking for dinner. The restaurant was mostly empty except for a couple of bar patrons, 2 or 3 four tops and a party of 12 (or so) in the back. \n\nWe were a party of 7, and it took the hostess a few minutes to figure out where to seat us.  The table selected needed to he cleaned so we waited a few minutes for that to happen. This was the first of several red flags for the night as it was over 5 minutes for the staff to clean and set the table \n\nAfter seating we ordered a round of drinks, water and some appetizers. The drinks arrived in 10 minutes, apps arrived in 15 minutes, and the waiter came around to get out dinner drink order. \n\nWe had to ask for appetizer plates. Twice. Eventually they arrived. \n\nAnother 10 minutes elapsed while the waiter informed a member if our party that her light beer wasn't available. Strange that they have Miller Lite and Bud Light but no Coors Light? Anyway, drink order was still incomplete as I was asked three times about which beer I had ordered (Innis and Gunn, off the menu). \n\nThe food was decent. Not outstanding for the price, but acceptable. \n\nApproaching 45 minutes since our arrival, still no 2nd round and we hadn't ordered dinner. We made the decision to leave and a member of our party approached the manager.\n\nThe manager apologized (ok) and then proceeded to claim no knowledge of a problem (hmm), blame us for not saying something sooner (not ok), and then had the temerity to ask us to give his restaurant another try. FAIL. \n\nSorry, mate. The manager should know what's going on. When he sees apps on the table, menus still on the table, no app plates, no drinks and it's been a while... He should stop by and ask if we are ok.  Instead he didn't engage, and as a result he lost is as customers. \nAnd I'm sharing our poor experience with other Yelpers in hopes that you won't suffer as we did. \n\nEpilogue: We walked to another restaurant in Mandalay Place, arriving a few minutes after 11.

Granted, this may have been because it was 11:30PM on a Friday night, but that's besides the point.

We walked right in through the entrance towards the back of the casino, and then up a set of escalators.\n\nAround the Chandelier you'll see a massive group of people to the right.

"When I saw this place while walking between Palazzo and Venetian, it looked good. So I decided to try it on the day we leave on Sat 5/25. I bought two denishes and a slice of carrot cake. They were aweful. Basically they were not made the day. I don't know how long they have been on display, but the denises are hard and the carrot cake has a taste of fat which has been few days after they were made. I don't this this place belongs to Palazzo.",0,1

"My mom and I went here to celebrate the end of my college semester. We were warmly greeted and sat quickly. We ordered zucchini fries for an AppStore and they were great. Very large portion, I highly recommend them. I ordered the prime rib and she ordered ribeye on the bone. My prime rib was good, not the best I've had. The ribeye was excellent, blackened and seasoned perfectly. Overall we had great experience, great food and a friendly staff. Our waiters name was Kevin and he was great, kind and helpful.",1,1

"Staying on a Guilty Pleasures tip, this Oxfam is a great place to go if you have a serious soft spot for soft rock, eighties pop, wack hip hop or white boy reggae! \n\nDevoted solely to the art of music, it has racks of secondhand CDs, tapes and vinyl at cheap and cheerful prices. Whilst most of the stock is too mainstream for my personal taste - think lots of Abba, Elton John, Duran Duran, Wings, Rolling Stones, UB40, Simply Red, Eurythmics & Leona Lewis - they do get occasional gems in. I managed to pick up an early Lee Hazlewood album last year and a rare Morricone soundtrack back in April. \n\nAs all the stock has been donated, the condition ranges item to item which means it's worth checking the actual vinyl or CDs for scratches or warping before you buy.",1,0
"The brisket was amazing and service perfectly executed.  Each visit has been consistently good and I would suggest them to anyone needing a BBQ fix in Phoenix.  The ribs and Q-Roll appetizers (a brisket egg roll kinda thing) are so worth a try.  Other than location, I dare say theirs nothing negitive about the place.  I personally didn't care for the banana sub-zero dessert and I'm not even sure why its called so since all it seemed was jello mixed with banana pudding.  That's just my preference though since others seemed to like it. \n\nSo I guess it would be fair to say, I love Bobby Q's...that said; I sure would like to see an option put on the menu where one could choose their steak hand-cut to order so I'd have the chance to get larger steaks. Perhaps a charge per ounce option maybe? A 32oz Strip, Sirloin, or even prime rib would be insanely assume!\n\nA manager did kindly let me know a larger steak would be possible if I called ahead and that they'd be happy to have my dream steak custom cut and waiting with advance notice.  While I nearly squealed in hearing her say so, I just don't plan ahead like, so I'll probably never experience this\n\nEverything else at BQ's so far (6 visits and counting) has been aca-ausume and  I'll be back time and time again since I now dream of that darn brisket!",1,0
"It's a small area, but big, beautiful sights to be seen. \n\nIt changes so there is high replay value and between this and the Fountains you can spend a few hours doing something FREE and satisfying.\n\n For those into photography, this makes for great practice area. For those who just love taking family photos, this is a great photo op. I will say though that during the day it can get rather crowded so sometimes it'll be a wait before you can get your turn and have a clear shot, but most people are considerate enough to hold walking through if they see you are trying to capture a photo. You get a lot of nice natural sunlight through the glass ceiling, but if you don't mind night shots, it sometimes is very quiet depending on the setup.

I ordered a large pie and garlic knots and the girl told me it would be about 20 minutes.  My husband picked it up and it was ready just under that.  \n\nThe prices: amazing!

I usually opt for the seafood risotto teamed with rocket and parmesan salad, a combination I find never goes wrong. \n\nThe interior looks good, very modern and light, with big booths to slide into and a choice of romantic tables for two for some hand holding and such like. There is also an upstairs level, and a long communal table through the middle of the restaurant, where people can sit either side, which I think is pretty cool.

"Johnny Chu is a master.  Sweet Pea and I followed him from Fate (which we loved) to Sens (which we liked a lot) and now to Sochu House (which we love.)  We've been big fans for several years and have eaten at each of his restaurants downtown many times, and after another delicious meal last night it occurred to me that I hadn't reviewed any of them!  Time to remedy that.\n\nAs a vegetarian, I am used to being under-considered.  In fact, I often tell people \""""I'm a vegetarian- how good can food ever be?\"""" when they ask me how my meal at a restaurant is.  I love being a vegetarian, and I love the food I cook myself, but I am most often missing that foodgasm so often that I sit and watch my friends having at a restaurant.  This is not the case at Sochu House.  The man knows how to cook for carnivores AND vegetarians alike, equally as skillfully.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say his tofu is excellent, the best I've ever had.\n\nWe've been to the restaurant and ordered takeout many times, and both are top notch.  The restaurant has a cool, sexy downtown vibe, a great bar, and a great atmosphere.  Service has always been good when we've been there.  When we get takeout, they take the time to package the food in such a way that things that are crispy stay crispy, things that are fresh stay fresh, and things that are hot liquid stay in their containers.  This is far too rare at most restaurants.\n\nI have eaten many different things there, all excellent, and I've seen others order many other things there both vegetarian and non-vegetarian, and I have NEVER seen a diner unhappy with their meal.  Never.  My absolute favorite is the hot and sour soup.  It is the best I've had in my entire life, and I'm a hot and sour soup long-time fan.  It has so many lovely chunks in there- pineapples, jalepenos, delightful noodles, mushrooms, tofu, and things I don't have any clue about and frankly don't care because it is delicious.\n\nThank you Johnny- don't leave downtown for good PLEASE!!!",1,0

By 11:45 there was a big line of people waiting to be served.\n\nDespite the busy atmosphere, the service was prompt and excellent. Much of the menu is vegetarian or gluten-free. I tried the Medicine Man drink (black tea, pomegranate, cranberry) which was refreshing. \n\nI had a half-bowl of their daily soup, which was organic free-range chicken, brown rice, and vegetables. Although the serving size was small (it was a half-bowl after all), it was very tasty.\n\nThe turkey bolognese is something that my wife and I highly recommend. The turkey is minced and has none of the usual gamey aftertaste that turkey is known for. If you have kids, I'm pretty sure they would love this dish.\n\nThe fish tacos are also very tasty. Super-fresh and thick (albeit small) corn tortillas, with tomatilla salsa and perfectly cooked fish.\n\nDessert consisted of capuccinos and a dairy-free chocolate pudding with walnuts and pistachios. The pudding was a bit too sweet, and too big for just two people.

Valet is free and they get your car for you super fast. Within a few minutes. I loved not having to lug my luggage around. \n\nAs for the walk to the MGM grand and to the Strip, it does take about 10 minutes or so. But you are inside the a covered walkway the whole time and they have people movers to assist you on most of it. I liked the walk. Helps burn off all the calories from the buffets! Definitely doable.

The brownie was hands-down the best brownie I've ever had anywhere. The chicken curry dish was also exceptional - so flavorful and the chicken so tender.

First off, they weren't even circular, so they were falling out of the buns and all over the place. They weren't thick at all, but smashed down and falling apart and so thin in some places. They sent us new burgers after we told them, and the second round came out exactly the same. They hadn't even listened!\n\nWe left a little disgruntled. Don't get the burger.",0,0

"The infamy that arose from this race has been pretty widespread by now. But here's my take on how the race went.\n\nThe way they formatted this marathon was pretty horrid. They started the full runners at 4pm and started the half runners at 5:30pm. They divided people up by corrals per your estimated completion time. I thought I'd finish the full in 4:20, so they put me in Corral 8 for the full. For the Halfers, since there were 38,000 signed up, they had up to 41 waves.\n\nBy the time I made it to the 2nd half, they had just let the final corral go, so I automatically ran into the walkers. The final corral consists of the slowest people, naturally. Runner's etiquette is that if you're slow, you hang to the right. None of these people knew of this apparently. Also, there was a 6 foot wide area for full marathoners to run [since we'd be going at a faster speed than the half marathoners at that point] while the rest of the Strip was dedicated to the Halfers. Halfers did not adhere to these boundaries and a whole bunch of walkers and slow runners made their way to the full marathon area.\n\nAnother annoyance is that water support was on the left curb of the Strip, to the left of the full marathon lane. Therefore, if half marathoners needed water, they stampeded through the full marathoners' lane.\n\nSo yeah, I played human Frogger from mile 14 to mile 22. 8 miles of bobbing and weaving after already having run 13 miles was not exactly ideal. That being said, it was a great experience and I had a great run. I think, personally, I did my best, but I could have done better. I am very happy with my time and am looking forward to March, the next time I run a marathon.\n\nWhat's ridiculously crazy is that there were about 37,000 people that finished the race [out of 44,000 that signed up], add friends and family.. there were that many people stacked up at the Mandalay Bay. That, combined with the debut weekend showing of the Michael Jackson 'Immortal' show letting out at the same time that the marathoners were wrapping up their run, it was absolute chaos. The shut down the Strip until 10pm, so there was crazy traffic there. Then there was a shortage of cabs. The water they were supplying during the race was hydrant water. They used trashcans to store the water and hoses to distribute the water, so people were getting sick left and right. Someone posted on the Facebook wall an MSNBC article pointing out the top 10 worst cities to drink their water. Las Vegas was #3, lol.\n\nPeople were puking and passing out left and right, fights were breaking out over the cabs, it was pretty crazy. People on the Facebook wall were saying that there are hundreds of suits waiting to happen.\n\nI think this race is best kept as a half marathon and will likely return next year to run the halfie, since the halfie experience was not nearly as bad as the full-marathoners' experience.",0,1

"I ended up scavenging for lunch a little later than usual today, and wanted something light, and that's when I saw the new yogurt place on Mill Ave offered smoothies. While the outside still looks temporary, I assure you the inside is filled with happiness and kindness. And yumminess.\n\nIt didn't take long before an employee asked me if I had been there before, and explained to me how it works. The easy part most people get is that it works like most other fro-yo places in the area where you make your own concoction and pay by the weight. However, there's lots of organic yummy stuff too. Their smoothies use yogurt instead of milk from what I was told (which sounded heavenly). \n\nIt looked like there were a ton of toppings to choose from and about 7 or so different flavors of fro-yo.

Why people want seeds all up in their smoothie is something I don't yet understand. So I ordered a pineapple banana smoothie (my two most favoritest fruits) with some protein and energy boost. \n\nWhile I waited I noticed that there were lots of great signs along their walls informing patrons of what separates them from other fro-yo places as well as lovely little sign on how to make your own fro-yo sundae if you are late to the game :). I also noticed they have a club card that is free where you accumulate points per purchase. One downfall is that there isn't much seating - probably about 10 or so high bar type chairs along the back wall, but I've never seen too many people ever sit and eat in one of these joints, so it may not be a complete deal breaker.\n\nIt's a small but very cute and super friendly place and I really enjoyed the smoothie. I usually end up making my own because it's more convenient and I can get exactly what I want. But now I know, if push comes to shove, I can get exactly what I want here too.",1,0
"We got a clean room in the MGM Signature Grand on the third floor.  That is all we got.  Housekeeping never came even when we asked.  We never got our newspaper.  Getting on the wireless was a pain.  But the room was wayyy cheaper than the MGM Sig Grand.  I think its probably fine for two people (husband and wife who don't make a mess) but I wouldn't bring a whole family or an entourage in their suites.  I prefer places like the MGM Sig Grand where there is no gambling on the ground floor and I found the location uber convenient.  If I had gotten an ounce of real service, I would be giving them one or two more stars.",0,0
"I feel like it should be more popular.  What can I say:\n1. Juicy burger w/ any cheese you want\n2. Hand crafted shakes w/ real ice cream\n3. Thin crispy fries (I like fries crispy)\n\nHere's the rub, the food listed above is pushing 2000 calories, I'm 30 now and I live in Scottsdale, where I feel like everyone is fit or at least fairly thin.

"I will give only one star, but that is even too generous.  We were excited to go and try La Piazza Locale after hearing positive reviews.  It was the worst pizza we had ever eaten in our lives.  We come from an Italian background, my husband was born in Sicily.  They advertise San Marzano tomatoes, but we saw cans of Nina's tomatoes in the hallway.  You can purchase these tomatoes at Sam's club for $2.75 for #10 can.  The pizza was raw and inedible.   No one approached us to ask what was wrong.  We ate one slice a piece, then asked for the check.  The waitress packed the pizza, but we left it behind.  I will never eat there again.  I would highly discourage anyone from eating at this establishment.  I am embarrassed that they would call themselves Italian. Carmela R.",0,1
"First timer for dinner tonight. They were very friendly and the food was tasty!\nIt's kind of like Subway-esque where they make the items for you, not like Sweet Tomatoes where you make your own. I had a large salad (cobb with ranch) and my hubby got the pulled pork and cauliflower cheese soup. We also splurged on a chocolate cake slice and rocky road brownie, cuz you know that is needed after a semi healthy salad :p\nOn my cobb, I wanted to sub cucumbers for olives and asked for extra ranch. It felt like pulling teeth to get a substitution and extra dressing. Hubby asked for no cabbage on his sandwich, but got it anyway. His pulled pork sandwich was mostly cabbage. The little meat that was on the sandwich and they bread were really good though. My salad was crisp and fresh. The soup was decadent and creamy. We mostly just dunked the bread into the soup like it was fondue. So good. The meals came with a chocolate strawberry and bread which was tasty.  The brownie was super rich and my hubby who is a sweets-aholic could only eat a few bites. Same with the cake. I recommend splitting a dessert or just be happy with the strawberries lol.\nWhen ringing up they rang us for a salad and a separate soup. We almost didn't get our sandwich. They had already slid my card when I asked where our sandwich was and then they had to charge my card again for the difference. \nAll in all there is high hopes for this place after they get their grove on. I do wish they had a build your own salad instead of just subbing things on their current menu without having to do extra $.50 charges for adding simple things like tomato or cucumber.",1,1
"OK i had to write a review because I was very disappointed!\n\nI gave this place the benfit of the doubt only because i heard they had a great happy hour and it is a brewery! Plus they only had 3 stars when i looked over the yelp reviews, I wanted to help improve that......Big mistake .....I should've listened to my fellow yelpers. I decided to have my birthday dinner here on a friday, we decided we would meet early for happy hour then move to dining area for dinner. Well my small party of 4 got there around 6:15pm, we thought it was just in time to put in a quick order for cheap food and drinks, but it took forever to find an available server, one guy stopped by and said he'll be \""""back in a sec\"""" but never did. So we decided to move to the patio where we thought it would be easier to put in our order, the lady taking orders was nice enough to put our order in 2 minutes before it ended. We were rushed and didnt even have the HR menus to look over because they guy never gave us them and there weren't any on the patio table. She was also pretty slow at getting them, i'm sure we would've had 4 minutes to order if she knew the urgency of HR ending at 6:30pm!!  Come on now.....There were alot of older people and it got pretty dead after HR ended..\n\nAfter that we moved to the dining area where other members of our party met us. The menu looked good from the pictures and description they gave....but the beer selection was very limited. :( White ale, red ale, dark ale??? ok.. at least put some personality into naming them and make sure your server is educated on each beer.\n\nOver all the food sucked and beer sucked. No taste in either one.. It was a sad birthday dinner, yes i ate all my food because i was starving! I didnt get sick so that's good.... We had one beer/drink each and regreted the beer choice after the first sip, we left right away to get a real drink. Oh I did have a choice of either a free cake or drink for my Bday, I chose the carrot cake.. it was good, not the best. She just sat it down on the table said happy birthday then walked off......uh thanks yay happy birthday to me... oh and she charged us for the cake.. but corrected it after we mentioned it.\n\n I know better now to stick with the good ol' Four Peaks Brewery for GREAT Food and Beer!  They have an extensive selection of beer to choose from, even if it isn't made in their brewery!\n\nServers/ hostess were nice, except for mr. invisable... \n\nJust dont go....maybe for HR but you wont taste much:(\n\n*Excuse my spelling and sentences, just so much happened and I can't think right trying to get it all out!",0,1

"Don't come here if you have any sort of time constraints. The only reason I'm not giving this place 1 star is because I didn't actually get to taste the food. I came here for lunch knowing that there would probably be a wait. But, I was craving some chicago style pizza, and I had an hour so I thought I'd be fine.\n\nI walk in and stare at the 2 workers in the place for 5 minutes. Finally he asks \""""Can I help you?\"""" Something about the way he said it just rubbed me the wrong way. It felt like he thought I was intruding upon his precious time. Granted, the restaurant was pretty full, and they seemed understaffed so I just asked for a table. He told me to \""""sit tight\"""", which I did. I sat tight for at least 15 minutes without anyone paying any more attention to me. An update on time would have been really nice. Even just saying a word to remind me that I hadn't become invisible would have been appreciated. Of course they were too busy running past me to say anything though. After wasting 20 minutes of my lunch break, I gave up and left.\n\nHopefully I can come back and actually try the food. But, the service here is really poor from what I can tell. The pizza better be amazing; otherwise, I don't think I'll be tempted to come back here.",0,1

"We've eaten in Chicago and had great food, but this place is the worst. Maybe we just ordered the wrong things, but would never go here again.\n\nI got the bbq chicken salad and my husband got the chicken sand. My chicken tasted like a byproduct of hot dog, spam and chicken - absolutely disgusting. I almost hurled. I was so hungry and took the rest of it off the salad just to eat something. The chicken sand felt like a box of air when we took it out of the bag. It was mushy and came with nothing on it. Plus, they wanted $.31 for ranch dressing. You must be kidding me?! The onion rings tasted like frozen rings and the ketchup cups were so small, we couldn't even dip it in anything.\n\nWe saw a lot of people got the beef sandwich, and looked good, but will never go here again to even try it.

You can find anything and everything you could possibly need or didn't even know you needed for a party or event including: invitations, balloons, napkins, table cloths, straws, table ware, party favors (they have a candle aisle ), tiki torches, etc. Of course, Halloween time is ridiculously fun here, but they have these costumes year round which is great for those awesome theme parties you may encounter November - September.

"Of course we know that you get what you pay for, but I was also under the impression that if a hotel website offers amenities, that those amenities are actually provided at the hotel.  Not only was the description HIGHLY inaccurate about the actual stay we had at the celebrities hotel, but description or not, this is the worst, most disgusting room we've ever stayed in...and we often go for the cheapest most ridiculous rooms we can find, with no problems.\n\nTo start, let me go through the amenities listed on the hotel website - \nHere's what the website lists, with the truth about what we experienced:\n24h room service - NO ROOM SERVICE\nHigh speed internet - VERY GOOD INTERNET (the was the only good thing about the room)\nSatellite TV - TV DIDN'T WORK (turned on but volume button broken off and sound quiet)\nCD/DVD player - NONE\nAir conditioning - HEATER BROKEN\nDisabled facilities - DEFINITELY NONE (STEP TO GET IN AND NO ELEVATOR, NO RAMPS, NO DISABLED BATHROOMS)\nLaundry - NONE THAT WE SAW\nIron/ironing board - NONE THAT WE SAW\nSafe deposit box - NONE THAT WE SAW\n\nand from another page on their website:\nHotel Parking - NONE - 5 LARGE BLOCKS AWAY THERE'S AN OVERNIGHT PARKING GARAGE \nInternet - Internet Access - AGAIN, GREAT INTERNET\n24 - 24 hour Reception - TRUE\nClose - Close to City Centre - TRUE, PRETTY GREAT LOCATION\nBusiness - Business Center - NONE THAT WE SAW\nDisabled - Disabled Facilities - AGAIN, DEFINITELY NO HANDICAP OR DISABLED ACCESS\nConcierge - Concierge Services - NONE THAT WE SAW\nDirect - Direct Telephone - WE HAD A PHONE, NEVER TRIED TO USE IT\nHair - Hair dryer - NONE IN OUR ROOM\nTea/Coffee - Tea/Coffee making - BROKEN, MISSING COFFEE\nRefrigerator - Refrigerator - NONE\n\n\nso now - we entered our room, and weren't surprised that there wasn't a separate 'bathroom' - we expected it to be more of a hostel feel.  There was a toilet surrounded by loosely hung curtains, and a shower with a broken off door and a curtain to cover the entry.  This part was fine with us.  There was also a bathroom across the hall, but there was never any soap at the sink the entire 5 days we were there.  \n\nAlmost everything in the room was either filthy or broken or both.  The toilet was clogged and was not fixed for 24 hours after we got there.  the shower was the most god-awful thing I've ever experienced, fluctuating from way too hot to way too cold with nothing in between, but luckily it was broken such that the shower head only pointed straight down and trickled out, so it was easy enough to avoid the water.  The blinds were torn off and broken (although maintenance fixed that the second day).  The shower floor was black with dirt that did not look stained, but more like it hadn't seen a cleaning solution in decades.  The bed was the filthiest I've ever stayed in (and again, we're used to cheap hotels and hostels).  The small TV was broken, the coffee maker broken (and with no coffee), there was a mount to something that had broken off on a wall that had just stayed mounted.\n\nHalf the staff was incredibly nice, the other half incredibly rude.  The parking was difficult and far away, but would have been fine had we been informed of this before hand.  \n\nAs mentioned earlier, the good part is that this hotel was a great location to get from the old port to the Latin quarter to Chinatown, and the internet was very fast (a speed test put it at 5mbps).  Other than that, it was literally the worst stay in any hotel or hostel I or my husband have ever had (with that awful, dirty, literally painful shower really sealing the deal).  Stay at your own risk, and only if you really, really can't afford anywhere else.",0,1

It's in a sketchy area, but it is SO GOOD. Everything is perfect. Every time I go home, I have to make a stop here and get way too many items and eat until I feel sick.\n\nSometimes, it can be a bit salty, but the arepa itself is pretty bland, so it's a good balance. Their yucca fries are heavenly, and so are their fried plantains. The wood-fire chicken is so smokey and tender, the pork was nice and juicy, the avocado sauce is perfectly creamy, ugh. So good. They give you two sauces; one's a spicier one and the other is a creamy cilantro I believe. I like to mix them and drown my arepas in them. \n\nIf you decide to go here, which I highly recommend and will be extremely envious about, be ready to waddle out the door. If you're anything like me, it'll be nearly impossible to choose one arepa to try and you'll end up getting 2 and an empanada (which is also delicious) and yucca fries.

"I've read the reviews before playing and got me interested.  After playing, I'm not sure what you all saw in this course.\n\nI played the North and the South on the same day in mid March as part of our annual mancation.  We paid $320 to play both courses on the same day.  Here are my thoughts.\n\nEither courses lacked any real feature.  They were flat and boring.  No elevation changes, no scenic desert scape and the holes were generally boring in design.  Just a flat course in the middle of the desert.  There are plenty of better courses in Phoenix that are cheaper and way more entertaining and challenging for much lower price (500 club, ASU Karsten, Papago, Dove Valley, etc...).  If you want to pay this kind of price and enjoy the scenery as well as challenge, try TPC Scottsdale, Ocotillo, Raven, Triology, Troon North for starter).  I'm not opposed to high green fees just as long as they provide value.\n\nOn the day of the course, the greens were rock hard and didn't hold a single ball - not even a nine iron on to the front of the green.  When we got done, none of us walked away with 'oh, what about that hole' with any enthusiasm.  For the price we paid, this was not much better than a muni track.  Sorry TalkingStick, you're just a stick.\n\nOn the positive, the staff was generally friendly and helpful.  However, the Marshall did nothing to keep the guys in front of us at pace with the group in front of them.  I suppose that's why they took the 'Marshall' tile away and gave them more benign 'player assistant' title.",0,0

The only reason I am giving this place a 1 star is because it does have potential due to their food. There is not much of a selection on the menu but whatever I have ordered has been great. The problem is the management and staff. I have gone back several times hoping they have corrected the problem but keep getting let down by their service. Expect to spend at least 2 hours for dinner. Lunch time seems to be quicker since there are not many customers. We have witnessed the manager getting into a confrontation with the cook...the manager with the gray balding hair and bright red reading glasses is terrible. The band (that was local residents) was horrible!!! Their family members and neighbors were the only ones cheering. That night we waited at our table for 30+ minutes before we even received our menus. We finally went up to the bar and asked the manager if we could get some service. He was talking with some patrons at the bar and had no clue what was going on in the restaurant. He approached our table (still no menus in hand) and apologized. Then went back to the bar and got side tracked and it took another 10 minutes for a waitress to come to our table with menus. Not sure why we didn't walk out at the point but we thought we would get perfect service from here on out....it didn't happen. It got worse....our drinks and food took way too long!!! The manager never came back to talk to us nor tried to offer any compensations or apologies. I am done with this place!!!,0,0
"THIS is what passes for gourmet pizza in Glendale? I think not. You're kidding me. Grimaldi's is a sweet looking place in the desolate Park West. The decorations are great, and there is plenty of Sinatra playing to further the illusion of class, but once you sit down and look at the menu, the disappointment starts flying at you.\n\nAppetizers? I think not, unless you're feeling like salad. There is salad, pizza, and wine. Also, a full bar, with beer. Not that having a simple menu is bad, it's just that when pizza is all you make, I expect mind blowing pizza. This falls flat on all levels.\n\nThe crust I'll admit was decent. Just the right amount of flavor and charring. You're getting that right. But the tomato sauce? Nothing special. Do they buy it from Safeway? The cheese? Just alright for a gourmet pizza, and certainly not enough of it. As far as toppings go, I don't like the idea of needing to order extra cheese just to have my pizza covered. Also, I feel every gourmet pizza joint of this magnitude should have proscuitto as an option. 'Ham' just isn't cutting it.\n\nDon't fret, the white pizza was okay. It used just the right amount of garlic, and had a fair balance. It was a bit on the bland side, and I would definitely have olives on that if I ever came back.\n\nBut please, Grimaldi's, spare us all your pretentiousness. No matter how many decorations (your plastic hostesses included) you put up, or how much backstory you have about NYC, you define mediocre. Don't offer me some BS wine pairing with your pizza, the only pairing it deserves is a mug of Budweiser and a Yankee's game. It's just not quality stuff.

"Meh, my husband and I weren't impressed at all. I had the Orchard Chicken Sandwich with Sweet Potato fries. They were both room temp which just sucks.

"This is an excellent Roberto's.  I've been to others but this on is best.  The staff is very friendly and FAST.  But, the food doesn't taste like fast food, it's fresh and good.  I usually get the carne asada plate which lasts me for three meals!  The salsa verde is excellent.",1,1
"Went to this place a couple years back with family during a trip to Vegas and loved it! Ordered all-you-can eat. My dad even got sick for over-eating! We couldn't wait to visit again this time.\n\nWe ordered alligator tail as appetizers this time and they were yummy. However, the all you can eat platters we normally order was good only towards the END. It seemed as if the oil used to fry our fish and shrimp initially was old...yuck! I don't even want to know how old. At the end of our meal (as they brought our new batches) it seemed to taste better. I like to enjoy my food in the beginning. I inquired with our waitress about the oil used and she confirmed that she did see one of the chefs change the oil to fresh oil at the end. Whack! The salad bar was pretty sad too and didn't look like anyone maintained cleanliness. Might be helpful to put the same items on both sides - makes it easy to maneuver and avoid spills. I did like how they kept plates chilled for it though. \n\nOur service was good and our waitress did her job. Sadly, we've lost our craving for this place. It just isn't the same.\n\nNote: Despite what time your stomach says let's eat, this place opens at 5 p.m. - we went at 3 with ready bellies the day before and had sour faces :(",0,1

"Straight up, we did not eat a meal here, we ate dessert only and had drinks.  \n\nBeing only a stone throw from my sister's house and open until late, it was a perfect spot when we decided to do a late dessert before I left early the next morning back home.  At 10:30 pm, the run a \""""late night menu\"""" which had limited yet with variety selection of entrees and desserts.  It also had some recommended drinks. \n\nBeing a non-drinker, I have to go by the drinkers' opinions which were that the drinks were good. Upon investigation of the drink menu, an obscure ingredient made these two Hawaii girls go, hmmm. Li hing mui. Upon further investigation we found out that the bartender was originally from Hawaii.  Cool point. \n\nDessert... ah, even on this late menu, was unique and interesting.  At this late hour, one would be forgiving if a place just offered a slice of pie with ice cream on the side. Not here.  The were individually prepared and it took time to get it.  \n\nI'll say this much, when an employee/our server knows all the owners and their history, points them all out at 10:30 on a weeknight, and gushes about their hard work, ability to collaborate and be original; you as business owners, are doing something right.   \n\nOverall it seems that this place is ambitious and willing to take the risk, exert the extra energy and push the bill to get people to see that they are not a joke when it comes to creating an original experience.  I can safely say this, on this Tuesday night, by the time we left at about midnight, the place was even more crowded then when we came.    I am definitely coming back again to try their regular menu.",1,0

"So, I think this should really be 4.5 but I'll round up :). A newbie to the Charlotte restaurant scene, The Summit Room has jumped on the farmhouse-chic train with metal chairs, exposed wood beams, and antler mounts. It's a great vibe, perfect for a gals night out, a date, or happy hour. On the smallish side, cozy and a bit loud because of the close quarters. Cute, outdoor porch that overlooks East Blvd. and Dilworth. Yes, I suppose this place may be a little on the girly side.b\n\nThey have a list of 7 specialty cocktails that are all $11 and named after the seven summits--a cute touch I thought. I opted for beer and was happy to find a decent-sized list of local and regional craft brews. The menu consists of soups/salads, starters and share plates, and larger plates. They also provide mini cheesy scones in lieu of rolls. YUM! \n\nWe sampled the chicken flatbread ($12) with chimichurri grilled chicken, spinach goat cheese, confit oyster mushrooms, tomatoes, cilantro. DOUBLE YUM! Decent sized portion and a unique twist of flavors.\n\nNext up the mussels. Lots of mussels. To be fair the mussels were definitely on the smaller size but they were perfectly cooked and delicious. Mussels came accompanied by toasted bread to dip in the buttery broth.\n\nLastly, to end on a sweet note, we ordered the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e which was served with fresh fruit and absolutely delectable.\n\nOne thing I wasn't impressed with was our server. A little slow, didn't seem to really know the menu, and mixed up the bill a few times. Not terrible, per say, but definitely not notable.",1,1
"I had a high end sofa and love that had seen better days. They were still very comfortable, so I thought I'd have them cleaned and conditioned.

It's unbelievable what they did to each piece. Thanks guys for an amazing and incredible job.",1,1
"Just tried this pita place for lunch as they had mailed my office some coupons and I was pleasantly surprised! They had way more toppings than I expected (bean mix, broccoli salad, tabbouleh, 3 different kinds of hummus and tons of fresh veggies). I also really liked their tuna option, as it's not mixed with mayonnaise, allowing you to create your own 'tuna salad' wrap by choosing from their hummus options or other sauces.\n\n It's really convenient that they list the calories for the pitas and for $6, the 'regular' size was a perfect portion! I'm definitely coming back to try their falafel and veggie pita, too.",1,0
"So I figured for my 200th review it needed to be a 5-star rating. I didn't even know I never reviewed this place. Thanks Anne A. for pointing that out haha. \n\nI'm gonna tell you something, and I'm only gonna tell you once. Don't get the Octane 190. Don't get the Hurricane. Get both. Yes both.\n\nOk, so I was introduced to the Magnum 44 by my frat bros on a random trip to Vegas. Its a mix of Hurricane and Octane 190 with a shot of Everclear. According to my bros' standards, its supposed to be 3, which i half enjoyed and half regret. If you're looking to get super trashed, this is THE drink to get. I would know, I had it twice in one day and I was sauced the entire afternoon/evening. 23 bucks in their tallest regular bong covers you. \n\nBecause of Magnum 44 I stumbled into a jazz lounge at Bellagio and disrupted the ambiance talking nonsense at the top of my voice. Because of Magnum 44 I walked into the wrong hotel when I was trying to get back to my room. Because of Magnum 44 I threw up in the garbage can in front of the bathroom at MGM Grand and proceeded to finish in the bathroom like nothing happened. Because of Magnum 44 I blurted out in the taxi that I used to think 'this' was 'shit' backwards, but apparently my friend exclaimed that it was. \n\nMagnum 44 brings good times. I'll be in Vegas in a couple weeks. We will meet again soon Magnum. Cheerio.",1,0
"Meh, is right.  I've been wanting to try Vincent's since I moved to the area over a year ago.  I bought a groupon that I've been holding onto for way to long and decided that this was a weekend to go.  Honestly can say that I could have done without. \n\nOur first impression upon walking in was old and stuffy.  I get that your a French restaurant, but no need to decorate like we're still in the 80's.  Liquor bottles as a display? Doesn't look good.  It should have felt like an upscale restaurant, but it didn't.\n\nI liked that their menu is constantly changing.  Some of their menu options were actually pretty surprising.  My husband and I probably went with the least interesting choices.  I started with the lobster bisque ($8).  For our main courses it was lobster with basil linguine for me and beef tenderloin for him.  The lobster was just ok, the basil pasta was overcooked.  Mike's beef tenderloin was pretty good, but not worth the $34 price tag.  And none of the main entrees were under $32.  I get that you're a \""""fancy\"""" restaurant, but those prices are way too high.  I have no problem spending $30 on an entree, but it better wow me.

I also had their chili, which was tasty, but not very warm. When our waitress asked how it was I told her it wasn't very warm.

I'm only giving them 2 stars because from the outside the shop looks nice. \n\nBut what I don't like about this place is their false advertising.

I am here 25 minutes before then and they aren't. \n\nI drove out of my way specifically to come here and they aren't there.

"This little strip mall Indian restaurant gets a bonus point for being so beautiful inside.  Very contemporary with traditional flair.  It gets minus one point beacuse it was hot.  Was thA/C broken or was the food's spicey nature taking advantage of me?  It was slightly unpleasant but I will get over it.  The Guru Palace get's 3 solid stars on it's very friendly helpful service and it's wonderful food.  I have only dined here twice and it was consitantly good.\nThis time from the $8.99 buffett I tried the Palaak Paneer which is excellent. I of course had a piece of the Tandoori Chicken (thigh piece, I think.  I have a thing for meat on the bone-don't care for it.  That's  why I prefer Chicken Tikka.)  It was good but not as good as the Chicken Marsala.  Pungent and very flavorful. The rice was a differnt form today-not basmati which I prefer.  There was a new dish I did not recognize called Mushroom Matar (?).  It was delicious with bits of onion and peas in a tangy light gravy of sort.  I also enjoy the garlic naan.  No papdum was offerred this time.  I did enjoy a split of champagne which compliments the delightful spicey flavors without filling you up.\nI was so warm from the lack of a/c and hot spicy achaar chutney (my favorite) that I was melting like the wicked witch at my table. \nThe service was very friendly and I don't know how anyone could call this expensive.  I thought it was downright cheap!  $3.99 for champagne plus two full plates of great food.  It is a great place to stop in for reliable food, kind staff and beutiful dining room.",1,1

Some of the rooms were not completely refitted--my room was missing the mini-fridge and another person in our group didn't have a shower door installed.\nWhat's great about this hotel is the location.  Right on the point and what a view. You can walk to just about everything.  The staff was friendly and helpful too.

"Maybe 2.5 stars. I have experienced better from a martini/jazz bar. On a Saturday night, Sydney's was way understaffed. We sat (on the sofa's to the right of the entrance doors where there's a small partition/wall that keeps anyone sitting there from seeing the band) for a good 35 minutes before anyone came over to ask for our drink orders. I actually got up to go to the bar a couple of times (not being able to get the bartenders attention) to order a drink and get a menu. There was a waitress who walked by our group of 6 many times to a table behind us to service them without ever looking our way. We finally were able to order drinks and it took another 30 minutes to get our drinks. Martinis=juice with a splash of liquor so I always stick to my regular tonic. Can't speak to the specialty martinis personally but my guest noted that they were just \""""ok\"""". I ordered the chicken quesadillas and they were actaully pretty good for whay they were. Two of my guest ordered a bottle of wine to split. After the wine was poured it was placed on the table. Isn't a bottle of wine/champagne usually kept chilled in a bucket? No big deal, our waitress Nicole was knowledgable about the wines and cocktails on the menu and that was a good thing.

I am an OB card member.  We signed up for our memberships at Legacy.  I played the course in the summer and despite the heat the course was in good shape.  We played again today and the majority of the course was in good shape but there were several greens that had dead spots (no grass) and it looked as if they tried to cover up the spots with green chemicals of some sort.  Some of the cart paths had concrete that was broken in spots.  I guess for $49 I just expected the course to be in better shape and expected a little more of a top tier experience.  Now lets get to the worst part.  I decided to eat in the clubhouse after the round.  Bad idea.  Worst burger and bun I have ever had and I still have an upset stomach hours later.  I understand that golf courses really exist for one purpose but I feel like if you are going to have a restaurant and offer food that you should try to serve decent food.

About 75% of the time, I have no idea what I'm eating, but I always enjoy it.\n\nAs an added bonus, the last time I was there the guy who refilled my water was wearing one of those t-shirts with kittens on it.. their faces on the front, and their butts on the back.  I don't know if he was serious or not, but it was pretty amazing.",1,1
"I am extremely disappointed in the Cox services. We have their internet service (wireless), and it is very poor quality. The internet is slow (no matter what device we use and no matter what room of the house), and occasionally it will stop working for a few minutes and then randomly come back on. After about 8 months of this service, we got a notice from Cox that they were increasing our monthly bill (for the same crappy service). We just switched to Century Link, and it is SO much better. And cheaper! The only way to get better Cox service is to pay even MORE and upgrade to a higher-speed package... unacceptable. We've had bad experiences with Cox when we lived in Georgia as well, so we will never be signing up for Cox services again.",0,0

"The BurGR is a beautifully set out restaurant and full of lots of sharp-looking waitstaff, and despite a lengthy line for group-dining, as a single I was able to sit right down at the bar.  I ordered one of the special burger offereings, the uber cheeseburger medium well.  I think of burger-medium well as \""""no pink in the middle,\"""" or passably the tiniest bit of pink in the middle as ground beef should be cooked much more thoroughly than, say, a beef steak.  Many restaurants will not even have a medium-rare burger as an option owing to the chance of food poisoning from undercooked hamburgers.  When the burger arrived 25 minutes later, it looked gorgeous on its puffy roll, with the cheese nicely melted and the beef sporting a glazed, glistening look.  But the first bite into the burger crushed my enthusiasm.  If the burger was 1/2 inch thick, then the middle 1/4 inch all the way through the burger was pink.  2 days later I am comfortable stating that the burger did not make me sick, but for a guy's whose reputation is built on quality control, how he let this burger come out of his kitchen so underdone is a mystery.  I'll be curious to see what other reports come out of this restaurant.",0,0

"One of the best sandwich shops in town.  Going here for a week day lunch during rush hour I was lucky if there were less than 4 people ahead of me - in one of the 3-4 lines running at the same time.  Yet every time the lines went fast, the service was amazing and the food was great.  After 25 years in business, it's no wonder they have it down.  \n\nI was a huge fan of their chicken salad.  And their cookies.  Mmmm...  The place is huge so it's a great place to actually go for lunch - though with their phone in orders, it's awesome that they give a \""""drive up\"""" window too.  When I worked in the area we did lots of catering from there too and it was always a hit.  Especially the cookies.  At least, the cookies were a hit with me. \n\nIf you haven't been before, you've got to give it a try.  They are only open M-F from 10-4, so it's a small window - but a great break from the norm.",1,0
"I took my dad to the resturant a couple months ago and the first time for him was a good experiance.  the second day we went back it was not so good experiance.  So I have waited a couple months to go back and may never go back again.  We watied forever to get our food, about 45 min, when i approached the hostess to check she said no, this nice young waiter said he would, and poof it was out.  Not to mention they were still wrapping the silverware by grabing the fork by the prongs and not the bottom part, big health violation.  When i did get my order the waitress gave me the wrong bagel and she forgot the home fries.  I am seeing a pattern that one should sit in the male waiter section because they are not bitchy.  It is sad for the waitresses, because i have been know to tip a 100% of my bill since breakfast is so reasonable.  I don't think the owners and managers that the attitude of the young ladies is so poor and that reflects badly on the resturant.  I don't think i will go back to this one for a long time.",0,0

She refused to give me any information on the manager saying that his name was private information.  Their only remedy was to give me 20% off and remake the pizza and redelivered.  I would never tell anyone to eat here and will tell all my vet buddies and associates to never order their pizza.  I hope the manager or owner sees this post and contacts me.

"Our first time visiting the container park, my family (husband and 3 boys) and I stopped in for a treat. I believe we met 1 of the owners (Barry). He was awesome! He answered any questions we had and was very friendly. The candy is a little on the expensive side but we don't mind because we knew we were supporting a local business. Before we left he played a Jelly Belly game with us. There are multiple colors of jelly bellys but only 2 flavors per color. One good flavor or one disgusting flavor. You landed on white? Will you end up eating coconut or baby wipe flavor?  We enjoyed the game so much we bought 2.\n\nOne other thing is Barry seemed VERY open to suggestions on items to carry. We were trying to pick out a few things for our daughter who was in school at the time and I was talking to my husband about fake braces that I had seen at a magic store and how much our daughter would love some. Barry overheard us and explained that he was always looking for new and interesting items to carry. \n\nClean space, awesome customer service and good candy variety.

I would get the green onions again, the egg was a little much for me.

"Every single time I go there I end up leaving in tears. I gave the first FOUR times a pass because I have a drive time service contract and I guess it gets tricky with having to have a contract number ready and OIL CHANGES ARE 4,000 miles not 3,000 miles like normal. So I own up to not calling in advanced to make sure I had everything ready. Those people already know who I am and know that I've had a hard time there several times but the last time I was assured that he would make sure that the oil change guy would write on the sticky exactly at 4,000 miles when I needed to come back so I wouldn't have to drive up there for nothing just like ALL of the other times. Did he do me that favor? NO! So Today Clayton helps me and tells me that they aren't allowed to write down every 4,000 only every 3,000 miles like a normal oil change. BASICALLY TELLING ME \""""YOU DO THE MATH!\"""" He didn't say that but he should've. So now I'm stuck going home until I have another 600 miles. I've been there 5 times! Want to know what I've gotten those 5 times? One oil change that I paid for at 3,000 miles because I didn't want to leave empty handed and who really knows when drive time really changed the oil and one oil change that was needed for my service contract. 1,000 miles later.

"This place has officially taken the Number 1 spot on my Top AYCE sushi restaurants. So congrats Goyemon!\n\nAfter reading reviews I knew the wait was inevitable. This place is small! Very small space. Which explains the wait time. We got there and it was about a 35 minute wait but they do grab your number and text you when your table is ready. The text even says if you need a few minutes reply back and they'll wait 2 minutes. So don't wonder too far.\n\nAutomatically when we sit down someone takes our order. They must know the wait made us extremely famished! Ordered so many rolls (as seen in my pictures). I am a half roll kinda girl. I love getting half so I have more room to try different rolls. \n\nSome of my favorites were:\nSunrise Roll- This roll had cajun albacore (my fav), cucumber & avocado inside and its wrapped in tuna, yellowtail, shrimp, and white fish! I mean thats an amazing combo of fish. It taste so good! \n\n911 roll- Seriously the spiciest roll out there hands down. When we got it I thought, wow what a simple roll but boy I was wrong. It's spicy tuna with habanero sauce. Now I've had sushi rolls with habanero sauce before and it was NOT as spicy as this roll. This had my mouth on fire.... but in a good way! \n\nNigiri- Very fresh! The garlic tuna was to die for. And of course my favorite Cajun Albacore! \n\nSpider Roll- Very large roll of sushi wrapped in soy paper and not seaweed. Might need to bite it twice to finish. Very amazing flavors of the soft shell crab inside. BOMB! \n\nI honestly loved every single roll I tried. I wanted to keep eating but my stomach would't allow it. The presentation of the rolls and different colors of the fish used was beyond beautiful. I love when my food not only taste amazing BUT looks amazing. Even if I ordered half rolls of everything-- it looked just the same as if it was a full roll. \n\nservice was great! Thanks for a great experience Goyemon!

"Came in with a group of 5, wanting dinner and drinks. We live near Old Town and frequent many of the local establishments on a regular basis. This was the first time here. Although there were quite a few places to sit and a near empty bar, it took several minutes to be greeted by a hostess, two of them were too busy talking to each other to acknowledge us. We were eventually seated and the service was lackluster. We ordered our food and when it came one of the dishes was incorrect. OK, stuff happens, but when my friend told the waiter her order was wrong, he argued with her, saying he remembered distinctly what she ordered. But he was wrong. He hadn't written the order down and was simply wrong. He huffed and took the plate back, remarking once again that she had ordered it. The rest of us were served, and eventually she was brought her food by a different server. He said, \""""Lucky for you we weren't too busy or you would have had to wait a lot longer.\"""" That did it. We won't be back, and it's too bad. The food and the drinks are good. I tipped 18% on the $84.00 bill, but I shouldn't have. There are too many fine choices in Old Town. I expect to be treated with some modicum of respect.",0,0

This one was a Saturday) for about 30 minutes since the club wasn't even open yet, and then got in pretty easily. The sad part was, we got in and felt like turning back around out the door. It was kinda empty, a lot of old and awkward adults (not really a crowd for 21 year olds), and worst of all..\n\nthe music SUCCKKEDDD! They played some weird ass techno music that I could've done the robot to. We thought maybe it would get better, but nope. It was just bad the entire time we were there, sadly dancing in the corner of the dance floor. Dude, they played the boy is mine. Yes, the song by monica and brandy. Really? Do people dance to that music? Sooo awkward. My girls and I left after like 20 minutes. We sat at some slots, which I actually won at! Haha. So I guess that was a plus. And then some girl came up to us and asked if we would like to go to the old Opium, which I guess is called Poetry now. Anyway, that's an entirely different review, but it was fun there and better than Pure.

Oh well.\n\n\n\n\n\nEDIT 1/20/08:\n\nOkay well I just went to Vegas again for new years! And I had to come back and add onto this review. This time around, we went to Pure on January 1st. I kinda figured it might be crowded since it was the day after new years eve, but then again I also thought maybe it'd be not so crowded since everyone probably left town already. Welp!

What sucked was how disorganized the \""""line\"""" was for so-called guestlist folks. It was just this big ass mob around the door with people fighting to get the attention of any bouncer they could. \n\nAnyhoooo. We got in and it was hard to even walk around.

I understand if you want a shot or two of her since she's kinda famous and stuff, but really. Folks were taking pictures for like 45 minutes straight. Give your arm and the people trying to dance around you a break. \n\nOverall the place was better than the first time I went. Still not great, but better.

Sitting outside at night under the stars with a free-pour (but pricey) drink from the pool area bar is really relaxing. The beds in the rooms are comfortable.\n\nDon't bother purchasing Wifi (at $18 a day) - go down the road to Denny's where it's free all the time.\n\nNow, the bad. The rooms were absolutely nothing special. Bring your own Keurig cups as they want $10 for FOUR Keurig cups if you open the box... I'm serious! $10! You have to pay $20 a night to get a fridge in your room, the \""""view\"""" room was of a parking lot (not that there's much to see that high up on Freemont Street, anyhow. The service is TERRIBLE in all the restaurants and bars in the place.\n\nFor example... my husband and I received a coupon book when we checked in for our 5 day stay, and in the book was a couple of drink coupons for a bar in the hotel/casino. We sat no less than 40 minutes waiting (AT the bar...) with the coupons (AND tip up front...) while the bartenders whizzed by us, despite us requesting politely to be served each time they went by. The service was no better in any other part of the casino bars and restaurants.\n\nThe other primary complaint? The timeshare people camped out posing as hotel staff at your elevator entrance to the hotel... You can't get away from them, and had to pass through a gauntlet of hounding every time you got off the elevators! It's harrassment, and annoying as hell.\n\nFinally, a tip: If you get a coupon (should you stay here) for the buffet, know that it's only good for Mon-Thursday. The breakfast buffet on weekdays is relatively inexpensive, and the quality of food is good for the price. Do check it out (upstairs on the third floor).",0,0
"well i just called to place a to-go order and was turned away because they stop taking orders at 8:30, even though i called right on the dot.... they dont close for another half hour... THAT already put a bad taste in my mouth.. so much for a new place in the area...THANKS BUT NO THANK!",0,0
"I used to go the this restaurant, when it was a Moe's.  Moe's went out of business, and Filiberto's does what Filiberto's does.   It took over a defunct restaurant, and started selling cheap Mexican food there.  I had never eaten at a Filiberto's, or any other 'berto's in the Valley, so I begged my lunch group to go there.  Entering the restaurant, it had a rotting seafood smell.  I don't know what it was from, but it detrimental to the experience.  I ordered the red chili burro, it is my benchmark food for Mexican restaurants.  The red chili was chewy, under cooked, and lacking in flavor.  My other lunch mates did not have any better experience than I did.  This place is a definite \""""NO !!!\"""" in my book, and in the minds of the other members of my lunch group.  \n\nThere are other restaurants at that strip mall.  If you find yourself there, do yourself a favor, go to Pizza Roma, or Haiku Grill, or Sami's Gyros, or Port of Subs.  They are all superior to really bad Mexican at Filiberto's.",0,0
"Einfach l\u00e4cherlich: das Lokal sperrt um 22:30 (oder bessre gesagt es l\u00e4\u00dft keinen mehr rein) . Wir kamen um genau 22:31 (lt. iPhone am Welcome Desk) und man erkl\u00e4rte uns, dass geschlossen sei. Drinnen war aber noch richtig viel los. Ich fragte eigentlich recht h\u00f6flich nach, warum man wegen einer Minute einen Aufstand macht. Daraufhin kam dann der Supervisor und meinte \""""That is the rule, I am so sorry !\"""" Ich w\u00fcrde es verstehen, wenn wirklich nichts mehr los ist allerdings es waren um die Uhrzeit eigentlich nur ein paar Tische frei und die Kellner haben noch Bestellungen aufgenommen. Na klar, von den Leuten die um 22:29 gekommen sind ;-)\nSowas ist einfach l\u00e4cherlich, \u00e4rgerlich, unsympathisch und \u00fcberhaupt nicht verst\u00e4ndlich !",0,0
"Found this place while driving outside the airport before I had to catch a flight. Was tired of eating at the usual places in the airport, so ventured out and found a good meal.  I got there ~5:30 on a Friday, so the place was almost empty, decor was nice, somewhat upscale w/o being too stuffy, and the staff courteous and attentive.\n\nI perused the menu for anything that would catch my eye, nothing stood out, seemed more or less your typical Italian menu. So I looked over the featured three-course meal - starter, entree and dessert for $30, where you pick one in each category, figured why not.  I ordered the lobster gnocchi, ribeye w/ red wine sauce and tiramisu. On top of that they had some nice touches of a higher-end restaurant, complimentary tomato brushetta and mango sorbet before the entree. The gnocchi was the best - the vodka sauce was light yet present, steak was undercooked in some parts and tiramisu was good  though espresso was faint if there at all.\n\nOverall, I thought this was a very good deal for the food, service and amenities.  If I had to pay more, it be more like a 3-star, but if you can take advantage of the three-course special, it's well worth it.",1,1
"Great facility!  I have stayed here several times since they re-opened.  After numerous frustrating stays at chain-motels (that charge the same or more per night) I was so happy to find this quaint little boutique hotel.  \n\nThe rooms are beautifully appointed, clean, and surprisingly quiet.  I love the old-town ambiance paired with brand new firm mattresses, plush pillows, large flat screen TV, and modern bathrooms.  \n\nI am so grateful for the gluten-free food options and personalized, special attention provided by the staff during every visit. \n\nIt is also an enormous relief to have great espresso in Phoenix - right in the lobby!

"I have stopped to eat here a few times with my family and also a few times by myself. Every time while walking through the doors, I was greeted with, \""""Hello, welcome to Firehouse Subs!\"""" by several staff working behind the counter. I'm sure it is required for them to say it, but it is always refreshing when walking in. The subs are very tasty, restaurant is clean, and the firehouse decor is unique. My kid's favorite part about this place is the firefighter hat that they get. I rated 4 our of 5 because it can get pricey. about 6 bucks for a regular sub + 2 bucks for combo. Then the large sub is around $8 + $2 for the combo.",1,0

"Why did I wait so long to stop by Laurel Market? Who knows, because this place is fantastic! \n\nConveniently located off of South Blvd., Laurel Market's menu is chock full of sandwiches of all types - for breakfast, lunch, veg heads, meat lovers, etc. Make sure you pay attention to their deli hours (7 am-3 pm, Mon-Sat) so you don't miss out on a delish breakfast burrito or deli sandwich. And, as others have noted, there are only a few tables out front to hang out and eat - so don't be surprised if you have to take your goods to go. \n\nI tried the CAST sandwich - freshly sliced turkey, green apple, cheddar, honey mustard & lettuce stuffed between two slices of sourdough (my choice of bread). It was super tasty, full of sinus-clearing honey mustard  and plenty of sandwich. With a bag of chips, a can of rootbeer, my big lunch amounted to $9.90. Suffice it to say, I made a meal and a half out of it. \n\nWhile you're there, check out the other goods - plenty of chips and accompaniments, massive \""""Cowboy\"""" cookies, beverages, a smattering of wine and beer, and more. The staff here are extremely sweet and want to make sure you get exactly what you're looking for. Plus - they offer catering! \n\nI'm absolutely looking forward to stopping by Laurel Market soon to try out more of their sandwich menu and perhaps score a famed breakfast burrito!",1,1
"Very beautiful! was such a gorgeous place the view was a widescreen HD version of Pittsburgh point with the ducky in the river at the time I went. There was live pianist and singer that was just great. It was so pretty and formal like something right out of the titanic. I was pretty on edge I suspected my BF would purpose to me on this night at this restaurant which later I found to be pretty cookie cutter for Pittsburgh and lacking originality. It was really a great time but I haven't gone back we have since split and it taints the place for me unfortunately because my other half knows as do I that I got engaged here lol. \n\nOther then the obvious reason for not returning lets point out the positives. Great lighting. Nice wait staff, clean presentable and possibly the best view of Pittsburgh EVER. I got a Caesar salad which the waiter made table side and I got to ask questions about anchovies paste and what he was adding in our dressing. The salad had an acquired taste but still pretty good. I got a filet with mash and carrots. The meal was great is wasn't super over flavored which allowed me to taste the quality of the beef. The meat was much better then other places in the burgh and its wasn't too expensive. The night ending bill for apps, salads, diner and dessert was only near 100 and in the end they served me with a plate, plated with a diamond ring strawberry syrup in the shape of a question mark. They were really helpful helping the ex plan and definitely could tell it was something they were used to doing but i couldn't help but feel i was just another piece of meat on their engagement assembly line. I wish the location hadn't been tainted with a failed engagement cause they are a decently priced night out for any occasion or celebration, im not saying its cheap enough to invite other guest but i would definitely recommend this place for quiet romantic dates especially at night. Just if you plan to propose do it else where, I found when i was telling my engagement story to those who asked I heard comments such as how cliche, or how original, or gee-sh who hasn't got engaged there? Don't get me wrong it was great but give your gal a creative and love felt engagement stay away from going with the grain. MAKE IT SPECIAL. Make this the anniversary spot instead lol. I do agree that below food is kinda bland and mediocre for the price.",0,1

"I did not have a good experience here.\nFirstly, it was unclear where to order. When someone finally came to help us we asked for an espresso and a V60. \nA few minutes after sitting down, my espresso appeared. I found it to be quite gritty, there were a lot of coffee grounds in it. It did not taste very strong at all, which I can't really complain about. That's just my preference, I understand other people prefer weaker coffee. \nAfter waiting for at least half an hour, my fiance asked the barista to put his coffee in a to go cup as we were getting quite fed up. It was not particularly busy, we were unsure why it had taken so long and it seemed a little odd to bring the two coffees at different times.\nMy fiance found the V60 a bit on the weak side, and neither of us thought it was worth the wait. It isn't one of the most pleasant of places to sit in, balancing awkwardly on a high stool, pretty much leaning on the woman behind me. \nOn the plus side, we are a fan of the coffee beans Artisan Roast sell to other establishments and have enjoyed drinking this elsewhere.",0,0

"We stopped in here last night for dinner before First Friday. The place was pretty busy, and we were told we'd have a a 30 minute wait. However, it was closer to 45 minutes.\n\nThere's a big couch in the waiting area decorated with sombreros. The wall was covered with pictures of Frida Kahlo. I liked the look of the place and was looking forward to a good dinner.\n\nI ordered a chile relleno and tamal with pork in red sauce. My wife got a carne asada taco, chile relleno, and tamal with chicken in green sauce.\n\nWhile we were waiting for our food, we were given chips, salsa, and bean dip. The salsa wasn't very flavorful and the bean dip was lukewarm. \n\nIt took a very long time before we got our order. Once we got it, the food was lukewarm. The chile relleno was fine but nothing special. The tamales were okay, but again, nothing special.\n\nThe only thing I really liked was the carne asada taco. My wife got an order of flan. She's a flan snob and said it was one of the better flan she's had, second only to her favorite at Frank and Fina's Cocina.\n\nWhile we were waiting to be seated, I saw that there was Groupon available for Casa Don Juan. I bought it hoping it would be available to use by the time we were done eating. It wasn't, so I guess I'll be back.

"I hadn't been to this location in a long time and ended up wondering why  I don't come here more often. Probably the calories but the food was really good!

I love their white chocolate raspberry swirl cheesecake. They also have the best blue cheese dressing I have ever had and they do sell it to go. I usually pick one up once in a while and use it on salads and veggies. They do have a new \""""skinny\"""" menu with reduced calorie items but it is just so hard to pass up the other really good menu items! The menu can be a little overwhelming but is well organized once you figure it out!",1,1

I found this restaurant to be a perfect combination of fast food and casual dining.  There are nice, clean tables and a pleasant atmosphere.  Our waiter was very competent and friendly.  The food was not exceptionally high quality, but it was GOOD and it was filling and large.  I ate a falafel pita boat wrap, which was delicious and large for about $4.  This place is perfect for students on a budget, but the food is very good too!",1,1
I really don't think I'm the target audience for a place like this.  I understand what they're going for with these artisan pizzas but I really would just like a little sauce on my pizza.

"Great as part of a date night, or if you're a tourist wandering down the strip. As a local who generally avoids the strip as much as possible, serendipity just wasn't worth the trip. \nWe opted for the to go window vs waiting an hour for a table in the restaurant side. Line wasn't too bad and service was pretty quick. We had to try the frozen hot chocolate just cuz. I guess I can honestly say it was the best $18 chocolate milkshake I've ever had. It was very thick, chocolatey and rich but not overwhelming. Would I go back? Doubtful.\nYes I am yet another person bitching about how expensive it was, but hey its a recession and Vegas is full of awesome and reasonable places.

Drink orders were taken right away and I never had to ask for refills, they were on top of it. I got the fish n chips here to compare to the Town Square location. They of course were good and plentiful. My only complaint is that as our server got busy her attention to our table seemed to decrease. This location is somewhat bigger than the other in town one bar inside and a bar in an area that can be an indoor/outdoor area. Has a real comfortable fireplace area and many TV's for watching sporting events. Overall I will be going here as often as I can, great food fun atmosphere.",1,1

That being said, their food is just okay. Nothing spectacular at all. Beyond that, on our first visit, our cashier (not server, mind you. its essentially just a pizza version of Subway) forgot to ring one of our pizzas up. Then, when she dropped our food off at the table, she told us that she screwed up and that we needed to go back to the register to make it right. Really? You screwed up, you walked over to tell us about it, but we still have to come back to you to help you fix your mistake? Shit, many places would've just eaten their silly mistake because it was their fault...or at least not required us to get in line again, but these guys expected us to come back and clear things up after they both screwed up and stopped by to tell us about it.

"After going to see Eat, Pray, Love, of course there was nothing I was craving more than authentic Italian food!!! I've been here before for lunch and dinner, so Pestos was the first place that popped into my head. This place apparently has been around for YEARS and I'm not surprised-their food is amazing! I ended up getting take-out rather than braving the bar solo (there's also a separate dining area) and ordered the linguini with white clam sauce (it was to die for!), mozzarella sticks with marinara, olives (not a huge fan of the sesame bread that comes with it), and OF COURSE a cannoli for dessert! The linguini was perfectly done and the clam sauce was amazing with just the right amount of clams. The mozzarella sticks were so-so, nothing special about them that I was thinking I should have gotten the stuffed mushrooms instead...these I KNOW are worth it...oh well, next time. The olives (an appetizer) were a delightful blend of 4 or so different types and it definitely hit the spot-I love olives!! They come with sesame bread, which I'm not really a fan of but I was craving carbs so I smothered some butter on it and was over it pretty fast. Now, I have NEVER had a cannoli as delicious as the ones I've gotten from Pesto's! Ever. These are absolutely melt-in-your-mouth amazing! From the chocolate chips inside to the crushed pistaccios outside sprinkled with a little powdered sugar and a fresh, crispy shell, your mouth will thank you!! Everyone that works here is absolutely amazing! It's a family business and their pride of ownership shows in everything they do. I've NEVER had bad service here and even when they're over-run with the high schoolers (note to self: don't go during Seton's lunch hour), their service has always been top-notch! I highly recommend checking them out-even if it is just for an amazing cannoli! =)",1,1

She even brought over a box of tissue when she noticed a person at our table sneezing.\n\nThe only thing that was kind of disappointing was that since we has ordered dessert, we didn't get the fortune cookies and shooters.  And from all the other reviews on yelp, it seemed like that was the best part of the meal.  :(",1,0
"Bouchon\n\nDecadent, heavy, unapologetic about that. French.\n\nNot a big fan of the paper table cloth though that makes it easy for them to serve bread without a plate right on the paper. I guess that's rustic, old world charm?\n\nThe service was 4 1/2 stars. Waiter was very nice and sommelier very helpful.\n\ni had the Conf\u00eet de Canard: crispy duck leg conf\u00eet with Lyonnaise potatoes & whole grain mustard sauce. good  4 out of 5 stars.\n\nBraised beef short rib special. 3.75 stars out of 5.\n\nTerrine de Foie Gras de Canard served with toasted baguette 4 stars out of 5\n\nTo be honest, French isn't my go-to but I was with some friends who love this place. I wasn't blown over because the food while being good is not a meal I will remember. But I think that's my personal taste.",1,1
"Very impressive venue but super snooty. Bouncers, staff, and all -- snooty!  I remember for the most part that the crowd and music was at very high energy but didn't enjoy the experience completely because of the snootz!! \n\nThere was not enough room for dancing...too tight. Plus all the booths are all in the walkway, so it's very hard to navigate around without having to walk through people and their booths.

"This place really isn't worth one star but since that's the lowest option I have...\n\nI have been here twice and really didn't enjoy the first trip.  I enjoyed tonight's visit even less.  We only came here to eat because our favorite restaurant was so packed we couldn't even find a parking spot.  I ordered a cheese crisp with chicken on it.  It took over a half hour to get our food.  We sat there and waited and waited.  Our waitress at one point said our food should be up soon and then we didn't see her for another 15 minutes.  When my food arrived it was cold.  Not wanting to wait another half hour for a replacement meal I scraped all the cold chicken (half of which looked disgusting, btw) off the cheese crisp and just ate the cold cheese/tortilla.  My mom's cheese enchilada wasn't cooked either.  The cheese wasn't even remotely melted.\n\nOur waitress took another 15 minutes to bring our bill and asked if we needed boxes.  We said no.  Another 5 minutes went by and she came back to get the card.  By this time I was irritated.  She obviously had too many tables and couldn't keep up with her workload.  When she finally came back with our card she asked again if we wanted boxes.  I finally told her that she should tell the people in the kitchen our food had come out cold.  She apologized but after the excessive delays and the cold food, it's just not enough to make me want to eat here again.  The only good thing I can say is the chips were good.",0,0
Came here with my mommy friends after shopping at 4pm..no line. Sweet! We were sat down quickly and our server was on top of waters & drinks for all of us.\nWe tried so many different kinds of sushi. I could not find fault with any of them.\nEven the desserts were amazing. My only issue was our waitress disappeared around time for dessert so we had to ask another server to send her over.\nIf there would not have been such a delay..and we did wait a bit..I would have given them 5 stars.\nI will be back again soon though.,1,1

"Oh my goodness. I haven't had a good experience with Chompie's lately and it's not just this location. The service is ALWAYS a hit or miss.

I asked them if we had to wait to be seated and without answering, they looked at each other with a smirk and nodded at the hostess to \""""take care of us\"""". \n\nNot the most welcoming feeling. When a customer asks you question, you answer their question. Simple as that. I've been in the restaurant industry for awhile and I would never \""""blow off\"""" or make my customers feel unwelcome the minute they walk in. \n\nOur server was alright, except for the fact we didn't get a single drink refill until she handed us our check...which implies that she didn't stop by to check on us at all.

"Took the mom and sister here for a cool down today and WOW! I had the Vesuvio, which had the ability to literally fill my mouth with flavor bursting from each little paddle full of goodness. Thankfully I chose the single scoop, because honestly it was so rich that I probably  would have gone in to an embarrassing moaning fest if there had been any more in my cup. Mom had the Light Mint Chip - a refreshing choice on such a hot summer day. Sister brazenly went for two scoops of Caffe Espresso paired with Chocolate.

"Our Biaggi's experience was absolutely terrible.  From the service to the food we were incredibly disappointed.  We were served our appetizers about 5 minutes before we received our drinks.  The tomato soup was extremely acidic.  Our entrees were then brought out before our appetizers were even cleared away, and we had to hold our own appetizer plates for the server to \""""switch plates with him.\""""  The entrees were terrible and for the quality were certainly overpriced.  The eggplant parmigiana was clearly cooked several hours, if not a day before.  It was not at all crispy.  The rigatoni bolanese was supposed to have  tomato cream sauce, but there was no sauce to be seen.  Our server then came over, while I still had a piece of bread in my hand and was eating my food, and had almost a full glass of wine left and said, \""""do you guys want a couple boxes?\""""  We said yes, thinking that he would bring us two boxes, but at that point he took our plates away (while I was obviously still eating).  I am fine with taking the plates away to box them up, but that should be stated clearer because I would have said, \""""No, I'm still eating.\""""  The server then asked us if we would also like for him to box up our extra bread.  We said yes.  When we got home and opened our leftovers the next day, we found that he had not packed the bread.  We will not be returning to Biaggi's.  If I could give this place zero stars, I would.",0,0

"I grew up in Squirrel Hill and have been going to the Squirrel Hill Flower Shop for the 20 years I lived there and then phoning in orders for the ten years since I left. I felt loyal to them since they're a local business in my neighborhood. But they are so consistently unpleasant when I phone, and seem disinterested in my business and reluctant to help me to select flowers. For example, this morning when I phoned:\n\nme: I'd like to send flowers to my mother.\nthem: we're only doing open (\""""open-something\"""" - I can't remember the term).\nme: what is that?\nthem: designer choice\nme: what is that?\nthem: the florist puts stuff together\nme: can you describe anything more about the \""""stuff\""""?\nthem: no, we can't tell you the type of flowers or colors.\nme: well, it's hard to spend money on something when you know nothing about it. can I get it without the vase.\nthem: yes. it's $50 plus $10 deliver.\nme: and without the vase?\nthem: it's still $50.\n\nSo I declined and found, through Yelp, Alex's flowers on Craig Street, where the owner was very charming and descriptive about the flowers and what he could put together, and very reassuring that the bouquet would be beautiful.",0,1
"Hands down my favorite place to golf in AZ. Makes a lot of sense that it was rated 87 of the top 100 courses you can play by golf magazine and is ranked number 5 in arizona. Can play challenging from the tips but can scale it down from the multiple tee boxes available. Practice facility is top notch with putting, chipping, and pitching greens with sand to practice in. Has plenty of room to practice your 40 yard pitches without killing anyone or being yelled at. Pracitce in the sand because you will likely hit one of the 119 bunkers on the course! Staff is great and my starter Steve had PLENTY of knowledge about the course. Food was fantastic as well especially for the price. Paid 7 for a drink, sandwich, and chips. The sandwich was large and sustaining. Overall the course reminds me of where they played the pga championship in south carolina visually. Probably my favorite was not risking hitting a house and the silence that is never there when playing at most courses in Arizona. Conditions were great for the time of the season a month before overseeding begins. Some bunkers were underconstruction but were playable. Price wise I found a great deal online but would be willing to pay premium prices for winter conditions to see what this place has to offer when it is at its best! When you get out there take it all in!",1,1
"Happy to report that service has definitely improved!\n\nI highly suggest going during Ramadan. It is over August 18 this year, but that last day will probably be very busy.\n\nThey have a nightly buffet for Ramadan. Get there by 8:15 to secure a table, but eating (and drinking even water) doesn't begin until 8:35. Technically, if you aren't muslim you can eat before then, but it would be very rude.  Everyone else there will have been fasting since sun-down. About 8:25 people will start lining up to fix their plates so when the time comes, they are ready to eat.\n\nGo and get some great food and witness a cultural holiday different than your own!",1,0

"I have given this place multiple tries now and finally have decided to give it a proper review.\nGeneral Tso's is my go to dish for Chinese take out, an this place failed miserably on that! Nothing but over cooked chicken with a lot of sauce and breading and yucky skin. Yuck.\nThe lo mien was also horrible. There was just no flavor what so ever and nothing but noodles and what looked to be whatever mysterious vegetable they had lying around. \nIf I wanted to order leftover's I would order leftover's!\n\nThere saving grace is their hot sour soup. Very tasty. But...... I had one bad experience with it where I ordered a large to go and instead of telling me they only had enough for a small container, they put the left over/bottom of the pot in and filled it up only 3/4 of the way. Talk about shady service! I even watched them do it from behind the counter. Trying to pull a fast one on me. I think NOT!\n\nI'm still giving it a solid 2 stars because their egg rolls and ragoon were at least tasty too (other than the tasty soup, that is when they have it available). But in all honestly, nothing special. I can go to any Chinese take out joint and get the same thing any day of the week. \n\nSo yeah.....If you want good Chinese. this is not the place I recommend. If you want quick Chinese just because your craving it....well maybe rethink it or just settle for the China Inn.",0,0
"Hmm, what to say about Hakkasan... Well can't really tell you much about the inside due to the fact I couldn't get in; however, I do have some advice for my fellow yelpers and here it goes.\n\n1) As expected for a Vegas club be prepared to wait in line wether it be prepaid, guest list, or general admission \n2) If there is a big DJ spinning purchase pre sale tickets (guy tickets sell out before girl tickets)\n3) Guest list does not guarantee admission, we were on a guest list after being unable to purchase pre sale male tickets, waited over 2 hours, still had a bit of a line in front of us and were told \""""you may get in on time to see Calvin Harris\""""\n4) If you see a long line on general admission proceed to the nearest exit and find another club to go to\n5) If you just so happen to be a baller, this is one of those times it would be worth throwing down some extra dough to save yourself the headache\n\nAs for my night at Hakkasan, I was really looking forward to seeing Calvin Harris here on my first night in Vegas, as a matter of fact I was planning on proposing to him just because I love him that much haha.

"I love the vibe of the container park...it's a little gated off Vegas escape.  It has a more urban/modern feel than the rest of Vegas and definitely Fremont area.  The park closes to minors at 9pm, so definitely has a lounge/bar feel with some of the restaurants that line the lower level.  I'm not sure if there is a live cover band all the time, but on Friday night they were playing on the back stage.  Love that the drummer does vocals for the covers =)  There is a large child/adult play area in the center...with a huge slide.  Kid friendly by day with a preying mantus that spits fire outside.  I've seen adults go down the slide too...so parents who are scared of creepers beware.  Cute little boutique shops with the matching price tag.

"My daughter's cheer team stayed here for one night because that was about all we could take. Our girls are 6, 7 and 8 years old. There were all kinds of creepy people hanging out around the hotel along with a package of sex toys that one of our coaches happen to get a photo of.  One of our dad's was approached by one of the bartenders letting him know if he needed sexual services that he would be sure to get it there at Rumor. My cheer team was promised we could practice in the courtyard, but there was dog poop all over the place so that wasn't possible. Our cheer practice ended up being moved to an inside room, but the ceilings were short so we were unable to do our stunts. One of our moms had absolutely no hot water in her room to take a shower. the room I had was very dusty, missing a living room lamp, the sofa had black stains on it and had no throw pillows on the beds. The room literally had to be cleaned while we were in it. \n\nOverall it was HOTEL HELL. Nice try, but I can never do it again.",0,0

"I received a recommendation to eat here from the driver at my hotel. She loved a specific salad and thought I might enjoy the restaurant. I arrived to a beautiful restaurant with a friendly staff. I moved outside, as the night was warm. I ordered wine and asked the server to return so that I could order my appetizer. The restaurant was virtually empty, but she took a very long time. Eventually, I placed my order. I received my dinner before my appetizer. I ordered the seafood cheese springroll. It was not good. There is no other way to say it. It tasted like cream cheese in a spring roll. The crab and pollack was missing in action. I couldnt finish it and the server never asked me how it was. \n\nThe entree itself, a stirfry dish with panang curry was delicious. It wasnt the best I've tasted, but it was still very good. Now..with my wine glass empty and half of my entree gone, I waited for the server to order more wine. She never came. After 20 minutes, I got up and asked the hostess for my server. The hostess was going home so couldnt help me. I waited a bit more and then asked again for the waitress. After half an hour, a young lady came out and said, I'm sorry but your server went home. \n\nThe manager never came out to explain. No one asked if I needed or wanted anything. She just said, your server went home and gave me a check. I looked at the bill and realized that she had overcharged me. The seafood yuck was on the menu for $8, but she charged me $10. Then, I had to wait for her to call the manager and for him to fix the bill. Still, he did not appear in this very empty restaurant. He called from the back and said I fixed it. He took $5.00 off instead of the overcharge of $2.00. Perhaps this was to placate me. How about, Oh, I'm so sorry that we sent your server home without giving you another server. Oh, you didnt like the seafood springroll, can we get you something else instead. Nothing. \n\nI left the restaurant and determine that I would never go back again. It was definitely below the level of a good restaurant. Below fair as well. I guess this means poor.",0,1

I think the only thing that can be hit or miss here is the service from time to time, but that is soon forgotten with a sniff of the fresh bread.

I felt the mashed potatoes were missing something, they were dying for truffle or something savory. My steak was a little over cooked. \n\nIssue: A girl at our table's steak was WAY undercooked. Our server didnt come around for awhile, so she watched us eat. They re-cooked the same steak to re-cook it. I think this is NASTY. I would expect this at an Applebees, but not here. EW!

There are much much better places to eat for the same price. \n\nDrink Prices: $16-$40 for their drinks. Pretty pricey, but they are tasty. I dont think they are very strong, we had two BIG ones and we were still sober afterwards... $80 for two. \n\nThey also didnt do ANYTHING for her Bday!! It was a little awkward. I wasn't expecting a song or dance, but a free shot or a comped dessert would have gone a LONG way. Each person in our party left with a $60+ tab.

Outside of that it was fine, it was pleasantly spicy, and would have otherwise been mediocre Chinese food (I prefer thai in any case).\n\nThis is definitely a place geared for delivery. The internal appearance was very dingy, and as another reviewer commented, there are boxes and things sitting around out in the main area. The service wasn't horrible; it's not exactly sit down service; you order from a counter, but I -did- have the food brought to my table. \n\nHad the food not been so greasy (seriously, they could have used 1/4th the oil they did, which still would have been a little much, but certainly within the realm of 'okay' for my standards), and had the internal decor been a bit better (remove the boxes, ensure everything is clean and a bit better lit), and I could see giving this place another star or two...but as it was, I regretted going in.",0,0

"To be perfectly (and embarrassingly) honest, I started going to Industry specifically because I knew I would not see anyone that I knew there. Sometimes you just really don't want a place where anybody knows your name. Sometimes you want to be a girl, alone at a bar, drinking a bourbon and reading a book. And Industry fits the bill perfectly. It's a good-looking place with a giant bar area and plenty of table seating -- but who cares about that when you want to eat alone? It's not too dark, there are lots of TVs, the music is a mystifying mix of Vampire Weekend, Beyonce and 80s, the servers range from charmingly social to semi-efficiently disinterested (which I'm ok with), the food is decent -- I like the salads and the flatbreads but have heard mixed things about everything else -- and the drinks are interesting. Basically, it's the perfect combination of safe and anonymous, with the added benefit of a competent kitchen. \n\nThe cocktails tend to be on the sweet side and for some reason the person who designed the menu decided to name both a drink and a salad the Menlo Park, which makes for some confusion and seems like a ridiculous oversight. \n\nPricing is reasonable: many menu items are under $10.00. The cocktails are also reasonable but, given the sweetness, not really worth it. Or maybe they are. It depends what you like.\n\nBasically, this is a place I go by myself. Maybe I'd go with friends.

"Saw them for the first time when they were at Monte Carlo and this is my second time seeing them for their Prism show in Luxor. Both times their performances were amazing. I like that they incorporate some story/plot to the show rather than just random dances. They are very creative. I also like that there is some humor to the show and that there is audience interaction. One tip though is to try to get seats in the middle row probably middle ways from the stage. Me and my brother were on the second row from the front on the left side and though we could see up close we couldn't always see what was happening on the right side. Plus, the speakers were very loud. Overall a very good show that I would see again.",1,1

"I love mexican food and I would want mexican food for lunch everyday if I can.  \nNow you can guess how excited I was when I found out that I had mexican restaurant right next where I work.  \n\nBut sadly enough this Macayo's mexican kitchen was not a real mexican restaurant.\nThey make McDonald version of Mexican food. \nI can tell that they use low quality meat, chiken etc. \nI am so sad that have to drive at least 5 minutes to get real mexican food.",0,0
"I've been coming to this restaurant since 2008- I can say I've never had a bad experience or meal. The food has always been consistently delicious, warm, and savory. My nana was Cuban and the food here brings it pretty close to her home cooked meals. The service has always been friendly and the restaurant well kept with a very inviting decor. I've recommended and brought many friends and relatives here and they have all agreed that compared to Versailles or other Cuban restaurants we have been too this is by far the Best. \n\nEven my Cuban friends have loved the experience and food here. Today I was back in Vegas and as is usual for me I went in for lunch with a friend who had never had Cuban food. She LOVED IT! The croquetas were delicious, as was my Picadillo (as usual) and the Salmon was exquisite. \n\nWhen we finished our meal we asked we could we go to catch a cab back to the Treasure Island, the waitress offered to call for one. After waiting no more than 5 minutes the owner Sergio- came out to try to flag one down. Since no one was stopping he then went back into the restaurant, grabbed his keys and told us: \""""follow me ladies I will drive you.\"""" NOW THAT'S CUSTOMER SERVICE! \n\nThank you Sergio for your kindly driving us back to our hotel. We will definitely remain loyal patrons of your restaurant! Love, Angelica & DeeDee",1,1
"Terrible!  I chose this office because it was close to my work and took my insurance.  After waiting for over an hour past my appointment time, Dr. Blanchard spent 45 seconds in the examining room.  When I asked him to hold on because I had a couple of questions, he completely brushed me off.  Instead of making an appointment to come back, I said no thanks.

"La Mexicana is an upgraded version of the street vendors.  Good healthy food, prepared home style, this is the real deal.  \n\nThere is nothing pretentious about La Mexicana, including owner Roberto who sports a soul patch and perfect English.  The walls are decorated with memorabilia and the tables are large, solid and sturdy.  \n\nWhat makes La Mexicana worth the trip is the food.  It's made fresh daily in the small kitchen.  There are 3 kinds of chili (what we gringos call salsa) 2 red and 1 verde each with a distinct flavor.  \n\nThe carne asada is is grilled, thinly cut and goes well in the ample burritos filled with rice, beans and fresh cilantro.  \n\nThe chili verde, chucks of pork in a nice tasty brown sauce are equally at home as a stand alone dish over rice with beans and salad on the side or stuffed into a burrito, enchilada or taco.  \n\nLa Mex is about as authentic as it gets.  A working persons cafe, it is always filled with locals on a break from work, holding meetings or watching the huge TV that dominates the corner playing \""""futbol' or Telenovelas or the latest musical offerings live from Mexico City. \n\nLa Mexican is a Vegas local's hidden treasure.",1,1
"This place was very \""""eh\"""" I got the mushroom burger, it was big but flavorless.

"-I ordered a whole milk latte.-\n\nNew Lux is what some argue is a 3rd wave coffee shop. That's code for \""""we are a restaurant that serves coffee\"""". And it shows, just as it has in every shop I've been to that tried it.\n\nCoffee: \nThe roasting method is half science and half magic. It's like the creationism of roasting. You stop roasting when it feels right. This causes quite a bit of variation from one visit to another.\n\nBaristas:\nThe staff here are as cool as any of your friendly neighborhood hipsters. They usually remember my name and they do enough volume in a shift to get good and practiced making latte art. \nThe grind is pre-ground which oxidizes the coffee before it is brewed.\nThe tamp appears to vary by the body weight of the barista.\nThe pull seems weird with a bunch of gauges that seem placed there for show as none of the staff seem to pay any attention to the contraption. \nMilk steaming here is near perfection, with fancy pants latte art and proper cappuccinos. \n\nTasting:\nThe temperature of the coffee is perfect, as this is a component mainly of milk steaming skills.\nThe pull today however, was far to the bitter side making my latte taste more like an IPA than a sweetly balanced coffee.\nThe staff is more than friendly and when the drinks are delivered they call out your name and drink. It's presented in proper china and with efficient but respectful flair. \n\nShop: \nI love people watching here, somehow this is the go to place for scenesters and the beautiful people of Phoenix. It's like that club you go to that only lets models in. \nNew Lux suffers from some of the same problems as Old Lux; seating is akin to taking up residence in a sardine can (but there is a lot more of it now!). The baristas are either hard of hearing or just prefer that no one can talk over the music, I usually just put my headphones in as earplugs so I can think.\nTheir internet is still free and is vastly superior to the wifi they had at the old Lux. \nThe drink prices are fair and what you'd expect at any specialty coffee shop, the pastries can get a little expensive. Credit cards are welcomed and the loyalty card gets every 11th coffee for free.\n\nJeff is much more focused on the bar at this public house, which I'd recommend Lux for far more than for coffee.",0,1
"I got a good deal on a Groupon for the new Quaker Steak & Lube so we stopped in for a late lunch last week.  There were only a few patrons in the restaurant at that time.  It was so slow, in fact, that it seemed that we were a bother to the hostess because she really couldn't seem less interested in seating us.  Thankfully, our server made up for her shortcomings, plus some.  He was fantastic.  Very attentive and very personable.\n\nIf only the food was as good as the service.  Ugh...such a let down!  I ordered Mild Wings.  The sauce was ok, but the skin was too soft.  My son got the Medium spiced wings and he said that they were ok, but that he's had better.  My husband ordered the Philly Cheesesteak and said it was acceptable.  Nothing special, but not terrible either.  He also got a small order of Cajun spiced boneless wings.  I tried them and the flavor was NOT appealing to me at all.  The one saving grace for the entire meal were the onion rings.  A tad too salty, but perfectly crispy and not greasy.  My son and I liked them very much.\n\nThe decor is a bit gaudy, but I'm fairly certain that's by design.  I'm glad that we were seated at a booth because the plastic lawn chairs at the standard tables would have been very uncomfortable.  The only downside to the booth was that I was a bit grossed out by how filthy the framed picture was that was hanging over our booth.  It looked like some kids smeared their dirty hands all over the picture.  Seriously, it was disgusting and it even had an odor.  And speaking of odors...there was an odor in the restaurant that reminded of me the remnants of water damage.  It was really off-putting.\n\nSo...it wasn't a good lunch at all and we won't be back.  It's a shame because the concept of the restaurant is cool and the menu \""""looked\"""" great.",0,0
"This place should be ashamed of itself.  When it was the Red White And Blue, we liked it, people were nice, food decent.  This place is what I would have to call \""""abusive\"""".  Abuses your wallet, abuses your body.  The other restaurants at Mandalay are ok, this one is NOT.  Since Vegas has cleverly crafted itself for the new economy I suspect Citizens is top of its class.  They know people need breakfast and lunch, and this is the ONLY reason the place has customers.  Their profits come from over charging for low quality food to a crowd that has no where else to go.\n\nTo sum it up:\n\n- Grossly overpriced.\n- Hash browns = tater tots smashed into a mash.  Good job chef, your the best !\n- Overall food quality low.\n- Your treated like cattle.\n\nWill never return.  Drive to whole foods and stock up if you need a quickie snack or brunch during the day.",0,0
"Our worst meal experience ever.  The waitress couldn't get our order right to save her life, our drink order!

I say two and hold up two fingers.  She comes back with one.  Okay fine, we'll share.  The appetizer wasn't very good or hot.  Then our food came, the buffalo chicken sandwich tasted good.

"After having multiple menus sent to our home, my wife and I thought we would give this place a shot.  It was the WORST choice we could've made!! The food was absolutely dreadful!!\n\nMy wife was craving a pastrami sandwich so I went to the restaurant and proceeded to order the pastrami with cheese, along with their Brother's sub and an order of garlic mozzarella bread.  We first tried the garlic bread and it was so bad that we ended up throwing most of it away....the cheese was cold and barely melted, and it was of poor quality and very cheap tasting.  The marinara sauce that accompanied the bread was flavorless.   The pastrami sandwich came with some fries but was bone dry and they did not give us any condiments like mustard or ketchup.  Honestly speaking, the footlong pastrami at Subway blows this sandwich away by a mile AND it's cheaper!!! \n\nI had the Brother's sub, which supposedly had chicken fingers, bacon, ranch, and something else.....but like the pastrami, it was dry as dry can be and very bland!! It was pretty skimpy for a sub and it was also overdone because parts of the sub roll were badly burnt!  The box that it came in was overfilled with fries as to give the impression that the sandwich had more weight to it....a trick easily spotted by savvy foodies!!! \n\nOverall, I would not recommend this place to anyone!!!! If I could give it negative stars, I would do so!  This place was much better when it was Bella Lynda because the younger guy who made the pizzas back then was awesome, but I'll never go back to this place!!!",0,0

"Like other reviewers, we called and emailed more than 10 companies looking for landscape maintenance quotes with only a handful responding and even fewer coming out to look at our lot.  Adrian called us back and came out to check out our lot on the same day I called.  He was prepared to work that afternoon, but we had him come back a couple days later.  We have several large trees (including a queen palm) and bushes with about a year's worth of growth.  Needless to say, our yard was very overgrown.   \n\nUltimately, Adrian's quote beat the other estimates by a landslide, and the final product was above and beyond what we were expecting.

"The food is delicious and fairly cheap, but they only take cash and if you go at lunch be prepared to wait in a line. The line moves fairly quickly and the food slingers are pretty adept at putting together your food in a hurry. It was less than five minutes after we placed a to-go order and our food was in a bag and in our hands. The Akins lamb plate is a little skimpy on the meat and heavy on the rice, and I would have liked more salad. Chicken shawarma is a solid choice, again with the hummus, rice and salad.",1,0

"I've been to XS twice now and both times have been nothing but great times.  The layout is supposed to be the representation of a girl's body figure, which is obvious when you go to the bar.  XS brings in a lot of DJs on Fridays and Saturdays so just check to see who might be there beforehand if you're not into house music and whatnot.\n\nThe first time I went was back in November for my 21st birthday with my small group of girlfriends on a Saturday night. We got there around 10:30 I think, and there was hardly a line.  We decided to walk to Surrender to get our hand stamps there and get free drinks before going back to XS.  We came back to XS probably about 11:30 and at that point, the line was crazy.  The bouncers pissed us off because we already told one of them that we were on the guest list, but he told us we couldn't pass the line because we had to show him a direct text message from the promoter we talked to.  So then we had to wait for about 10-15 minutes before we could reach our promoter and skip the line.  Considering that it was just a group of 4 girls, this was annoying.  \n\nBut once we got inside the club, we completely got in our zones and started dancing away with random people and had a good time.

"Okay, we all know the food is amazing, especially since it's Mario Batalli's restaurant. However, what impressed me the most was the atmosphere.  Normally, the $50/plate kind of restaurants are incredibly pretentious and as a college student who can't afford these kind of meals as often as the rest of the people dining there, it really sucks when you can't have fun with your friends and talk during your meal.  Last time I went to a nice restaurant, my friend and I were almost whispering but at B&B, they had the Beatles playing in the background, the waiters were coming by to chitchat, and we even got complimentary samples from the chefs.  We didn't feel out of place at all and the 5 of us girls had a really good time.  \n\nThe food was amazing.  The octopus appetizer which all the waiters recommended was delicious.  I never knew octopus could be prepared so well.  We ended up getting 2 pastas to split as a first course and then we each got 2nd courses.  It was ridiculously filling. The pastas were amazing - whenever I see homemade pasta or homemade noodles anywhere on a menu, I have to get it.  I also had rabbit for my first time, kind of felt bad due to the cuteness factor of rabbits but damn, if I ever have rabbit, it would only be at B&B.

(Houdini raising seances are conducted there every Halloween.)  Our photos proved fruitless, but fun was had.\n\n3)  I was underage.  They served me booze.  I've never had a fake ID, nor did I ever look 21 when I was 18.\n\nNow, the latter, at the time, scored points with me.  In my old, curmudgeonly age I take umbrage to a place that serves minors.  The Strip is obnoxious enough without 18 year old drunks running up and down it.  It smells bad, the food court isn't fit for a 5 AM liquor fueled munchfest (and we know how discerning those are), and you won't get any pictures of a semi-opaque Houdini.

"Sorry, but I have to disagree with all the reviews on here. Upon walking in the restaurant my first observation was their decor. It was corny and stereotypical. It was like they were trying to make every square inch of the place as Asian & Japanese as possible... just in case you forgot you were at a place called MIZUMI.\n\nWe were a large group of 11 people and ordered almost every sushi and roll dish on the table, including the mizumi special roll. \nNothing was memorable.. Just mediocre.  I've eaten at nobu and morimoto which were exceptionally better. Even the dessert chocolate cake was dry and unappetizing.\n\nThe service was another disappointment. I normally don't like to comment on service for restaurants because I've always held food taste to be of highest importance. But, when the poor service means I don't get my food, we got problems. Getting a waiter to help was worse than hailing a NYC taxi cab on a rainy Friday night.  We were looking around for a server and they deliberately avoided eye contact and ran the other direction. It happened multiple times. \n\nWhen we didn't receive our sake order 30 minutes in to our dinner we asked to speak to the manager. The woman was completely indifferent about our comments of the lack of service. We left with a $1600 bill and completely unsatisfied. \n\nWe frequent Vegas often and enjoy eating well.

My daughter's confidence was destroyed and it took almost 6 months to rebuild her self-esteem (new coaches have worked hard to turn her around).  My son got burnt out with the intensity of the mens coach (he's 10).  Luckily, both kids are in good spots now.  Don't go here.  There are many other gyms in the valley and yes, the facilities are beautiful but not worth the toll on your kids' psyche.",0,0

"Although this running store is not in the most convenient location for us, my husband and I would drive across town to get fitted for running shoes. We tried a few other places for fittings, but this place seemed to do the best job and have employees with the most expertise. \n\nWhen I first decided to try running, I went to a bigger store and ended up with shoes that were way too tight and just not a good fit. A few months later, I tried this place and was really pleased with how thorough they were. Your first running shoe fitting can be a little awkward (I don't really like people around my feet anyway), but they made it very comfortable and easy and I loved the shoes they recommended. I probably paid more than other more discounted places, but I would rather pay a little more for good foot health and a better running experience.\n\nOverall, a great place to be fitted for running shoes whether you're just starting out or have been running for a long time.",1,1
"Just went to the pirate exhibit this weekend and I want to write a review because it was by far the coolest one yet.  I have been to the body exhibit, the titanic exhibit and others there.  Of course there is more to do there than just that for the kids, they blow stuff up at the lab, they have tons of cool little sections with things to do.  It is not cheap but we got the annual pass for the exhibits this year since we did the maze and we wanted to come back for the pirate and the Van Gogh exhibit coming next.  Now back to the pirate exhibit, holy cow they had a real life pirates treasure at the end that was valued at 400 million dollars!  The have tons of real \""""pieces of 8\"""" they also recovered the bell from the original ship they found off the cost of Cape Cod.  There was their silverware, belt buckles, guns, cannons, gold, silver, rope, and I can go on forever.  It was just super cool to hear the story and see all the real life stuff.  This is not just a kid exhibit and in fact I spent much more time reading things and my kids blew right through it.",1,1

There is plenty of seating, and the coffee is delish. The chai is unbelievably delicious.\n\nThe food here seems to be just so so for me. I got the big ben, and it's like eating a giant omelet stacked inside of an english muffin. The sauce to egg ratio was definitely off, and when we asked for more sauce, we didn't get any, even though they promised to bring it out. \n\nThe onion jam on the other BLT sandwich is AMAZING. I wanted to spread it over everything.\n\nThey got a knock down because their service is not the best, and the food was a bit underwhelming, especially compared to the drinks. The chai is thick and syrupy, almost a little too much, but it's great both hot and cold, but I prefer it iced.",1,1
Morty's used to be a weekly stop in for me before I moved away. As I just moved back I had to check in again. Conveniently it was a Thursday (wing night). \n\nAtmosphere is wonderful - its still familiar which I like. The menu has changed but I believe the food is still good. They are said to have the best wings in town - I am not a fan of their wings - but if your into wings this is your place. \n\nI used to love the pizza they had on the menu - sadly its gone. \n\nService is unreal (amazing!) - we had probably 5 waitresses throughout the night - one main server - but the others all help each other out - which means you never have to wait for anything. It's fantastic. \n\nAlso if your looking for a patio - Morty's has a good one.,1,1

After ordering it took even longer for the food to come out. \n\nWe ordered the fettuccine alfredo, sliders, onion rings, and monte cristo.

"Stopped in before the Coyotes/Stars game on Saturday.\n\nLike everyone else has said you pick your selection from a menu board. There are categories like 'vegetarian', 'salad-wiches', and 'breakfast' (served all day which is cool). Each category has it's own bag. You pick your bag and from there start customizing your sandwich with a red mini Sharpie marker. Lots and lots and lots of options which is pretty cool. At the very bottom of the bag you write your name so they can call you when your sandwich is done.\n\nYou hand your bag to the cashier who rings you up and then clips your bag to a wire and sends it on it's way.\n\nI also ordered a banana shake which was pretty darn tasty.\n\nMy sandwich had everything I wanted on it and the bread it was on was pretty tasty. \n\nI'm giving it four stars for the many options available for the sandwiches alone, the cleanliness of the place, and the efficiency of the staff. \n\nThink it would be a great place to go with a small group that couldn't agree on where to go....of course everyone would have to like sandwiches I guess.\n\nWill definitely go back when I'm in the area.",1,1

A place that serves tacos has a Latin night? It turns out there was a band who began laying in as we were leaving (which means we could have say in the dining room). The coctel was more like canned clams, canned crab, strangely halved shrimp in a ketchup sauce. The tacos were way overpriced, as was the beer.

We had the tomatillo sauce and the pico de gallo.   All of it, including the chips were bland. I had a  Stevia lemonade and my partner had a mango lemonade. Mine had too much Stevia in it and I am a BIG Stevia user. Partner's lemonade was so-so. Not much mango flavor and even the lemonade flavor didn't taste natural.

"I felt like I had walked into the first level of hell when I walked through the double glass doors into the Cox Digital Store to return my cable boxes. When I walked in (carrying no less than THREE boxes, with THREE remotes perched precariously on top and wires dangling down past my ankles), there were three ladies sitting behind desks. Two had customers, one was filing her nails. There were four people ahead of me. One lady looked up and barked at me to take a seat and grab a number (very DMV-esque). Looking around for a place to set down my heavy burden, no seats were available. One guy (a true gentleman) jumped up, grabbed the boxes from me, chivalrously gave me his seat, and then snagged an extra chair from the desk of the lady who was filing her nails (she didn't even look up). After sitting for about 5 minutes, one of the customers currently being helped finished up and left. The lady helping him got up from her desk and went to the back. The other lady with no customers also got up and began boxing up cable boxes (mind you, STILL five people waiting). The third lady finished with her customer, and (thankfully) called the next number. That customer must have had a doozie of a cable issue, because when lady number two came back to her desk, and was about to call the next number, lady number one called her over to the desk to help sort out her customer's problem. Lady #3 went to the back. Meanwhile, more customers began trickling in. FINALLY, they managed to get through the line of customers ahead of me, and it was my turn (30 minutes later). I walked up with my cable boxes (none of which she offered to help me with), and when I told her I needed to return them because my service had been canceled, she just looked at me and said \""""you know you could have just mailed those in, right?\"""". Um, NO! No one told me that! Would've been helpful, especially since this particular cable hell is located so far north in Scottsdale, I felt like I truly was leaving the city to go on a pilgrimage (similar to Dante's).

"Worst experience with a hairdresser ever, at this location. Made an appointment with Diane for a body wave. When I was sort of greeted by her she looked at my hair and said \""""You get body waves?\"""" Yeah, that's why I booked one at your salon. Then she argued with me about when to trim, I wanted after she wanted before, and after five minutes acknowledged that it didn't matter, but FIRST telling me the perm \""""wouldn't soak in\"""" on the ends unless she trimmed it. Then she argued with me about the rods. It's taken me over ten years to figure out with Aveda perm hairstylists what the perfect combo is. Diane knew better, but finally agreed. Then she proceeded to comb my wet hair, from the forehead back, scratching my scalp and jerking my head. That wasn't enough, though. She then started rolling it with the rods she thought I should have.  I got up and left.

"This review is somewhat unfair. I did go with a giant group of Yelpers, so I cannot say if the most excellent and amazing service was due to that, or if it is always like that, but I can say that, at least that night, the service was wonderful.

He was attentive without being overbearing and he remembered all of our names... that's right, like 25 of our names.... that is insanity! We came for happy hour and build your own burgers and happy it was! They had many delicious beers on tap, with the local beers being on special for 4$. I had a Four Peaks peach... it was delish, as per usual. The build your own burger deal is pretty amazing, you fill out an order form with all of the toppings you would like for 10$.

Unfortunately, when the burger came out it was missing several of the toppings (including the bacon, blasphemy!) and the over easy egg was nearly cooked through.

But I will try to edit myself....*try* being the operative word. I could only eat half and I was sooo full. I also had sweet potato tots.. they were good, but after trying someone else's chips...those are definitely the way to go. \n\nAs others have mentioned, they have a great Yelp check in special... 5$ off, and they honored it for all of us, which was totally unnecessary, but much appreciated.

"My friends and I stayed at the Trump International Hotel from 4/29/11 to 5/1/11. We had a bad experience from the moment we arrived.  The valet who unloaded our car opened the back of the van hastily and several of our bags fell out, he picked the bags up without apologizing placed them on the bellhop cart and as he pushed them away our bags fell off the cart again.  When we walked into the Lobby we were extremely impressed, it was gorgeous!  They pump in floral scents and there are chandeliers and gold everywhere.  But, that was where it ended for us.  The hotel claimed to not have our reservation even though there was a hold placed on my friends credit card.  When they found our reservation they said they would not be able to place us in adjoining suites.  When we argued with the girl she suddenly found two suites for us.  We entered the suites and began looking around.  At first sight the suite was beautiful, then we noticed a weird hissing sound coming from the windows, when we asked the bellhop about it he explained that sometimes the window system that allows fresh air in will break and we might be unable to close it, but he suggested we call the maintenance staff and they would bring us some duct tape to tape over the vent.  Really?  The TV in the living room area did not work and we had to call maintenance to come and fix the TV.  The TV in the bathroom did not work either.  The beds were made, but the carpet was filthy, and there was dirt on the sofas.  There were no extra towels (one bath towel and one hand towel per bathroom in both suites), no extra toilet paper or tissue, and one pillow per pullout sofa.  As we were unpacking one of the housekeeping workers came to the room to apologize for the room being unfinished, she complained to us that it was because \""""they called me and told me to stop cleaning\"""".  I found it unprofessional she would complain to us.  The man who came to clean the carpet (yes, it was bad enough they had to shampoo the carpet) apologized for the room and said it was unacceptable that we were given a room like that.  When one friend who did not drive with us arrived, the valet lost her key.  She handed it to him, he somehow dropped it and he approached her as she checked in and accused her of not giving him the key.  When she was unable to find it in her purse they told her that because SHE lost the key they would need to tow her car at her expense.  They called her a few minutes later in the room to tell us that they found her key on the ground under her car.  Again, no apology for being rude.  The only staff we had contact with that were friendly were the room service staff.  Although we did find it odd that they never once rang the doorbell, they just entered the room.  The good things about the hotel were the lobby, the roomservice (reasonable prices and delicious food), and the free shuttle service.  I also liked that it is the only pet friendly luxury hotel in the area.  They even sold pet \""""gifts\"""" in the gift shop.  But, I will not stay at this hotel again.",0,0

The ride is only 15 minutes for goodness sake! The woman at the desk told me they couldn't refund my money and she checked my reservation--it was at 8pm. At this point I'm boiling mad but trying to keep my cool. I told her I wanted a refund or to be on the next ride out. She assured me that I would be next and that she would give me a free DVD of our flight. OK, at least she offered me something for their royal mistake. However, we weren't called until after 7pm and didn't finish until around 8pm. The actual ride was awesome and if it hadn't been for the fact that my boyfriend was pretty excited about it, I would have just left earlier. We ended up missing the show we wanted to see (this was our last night in town) and just went out to dinner. \nI think this could be a great thing if they were more organized. Over-booking people and making them wait around for three hours just isn't acceptable. There were a lot of aggravated people in the waiting room and I really wouldn't recommend it. For the amount of time you're waiting...just try and get a window seat on your plane ride home. The view of the strip is almost as good as it is in the helicopter.",0,1
"One star because it is a nice dark room in the traditional sense and it fairly well appointed.  Also, there's something behind those walls that understands restaurants, it's just too bad that it falls into the hands of those that have lost their passion for the people that patronize the place. And finally they Yelp won't allow Zero stars.\n\nDecent bar to grab a glass of Champagne and the hostess seemed nice when I said I wanted to have a drink there and hold the table for 15 minutes.

They also gave our table two orders of garlic naan. The naan was piping hot and full of garlic.\n\nI would say the amount of meat in the curries was minimal but given it was a buffet I understood. Plus the flavors of all of the curry dishes were each so delicious and unique that the sauce with naan was enough for me.\n\nI'm used to having curry in a non AYCE setting and I don't know if I'll ever do that again. The value of the buffet was really good for the variety.\n\nI also liked their fried onion fritters, the veggie samosas, and their rice and chicken dish.

They also cleaned up our plates before I got back from each trip the buffet line\n\nThey also had this spice mix when you leave up front that was full of spices they used like dinner mints which was cool to try.\n\nI like the value, the restaurant staff, the decor, and definitely the flavors.

It came with a mixed green salad with balsamic vinaigrette that was pretty tasteless.  The chicken parmigiana was just okay.  Nothing standout, and dare I say, Olive Garden has a better chicken parmigiana.  The entree came with a side of ziti that was decent, but nothing special.  I was shocked when the bill came...$34 before tip.  The wine was $8 so the chicken parm cost $26?  Never again.  The food is drastically over-priced for the quality you get.  I won't go back.",0,1
"AVOID!! AVOID!!  IF YOU WANT TO BE FOOD POISONED, GO HERE!! AVOID! AVOID!\n\nFirst of all the female manager is an absolute JERK!  She has an attitude of arrogance with a side of rudeness!!

I was STUNNED!!  I started to say, \""""What are you doing?\"""" and she immediately went back into the back room again.  I got really angry and said, \""""What is going on?... Why would she put that powder in my drink?  What is the powder substance?\"""" \n\nThe gal that waited on me stated she was going to find out & went into the back room and came out a minute later.

"I've been coming to El Burrito since I was in Middle School and it's still one of my favorite homegrown Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas.\n\nI've never really had a bad experience or bad food at this place because I pretty much stick to three things on the menu because each of those items are so good that I just never decided to branch out and try anything else.\n\nThe complimentary chips and salsa are always an awesome start to the meal.

"YOUR GUIDE TO A SUCCESSFUL FLAMINGO HOTEL STAY\n\nAfter pretty much reading nothing but negative reviews I think I need to share what I think makes for a great Flamingo Hotel experience.  We have done an annual man-cation here for the last 4 years in July and  I don't have a single complaint and below are a couple reasons why.  I do understand the Flamingo can be a little difficult to navigate and in some aspects has kind of turned into a In and Out Burger type establishment where you need to know the secret menu but here is your secret menu:\n\n1.  This is the FLAMINGO so you are already setting yourself up for failure if you go in expecting the Wynn or some other fancy hotel I have only seen the outside of.  Wrap your head around that before booking at this hotel.  I am not someone who subscribes to the theory of just getting a crap hotel because you are never in it.  I want a good bed and nice shower even if I do plan on being in the room 6 hours over the course of 3 days.  You can still get a quality room at the Flamingo if you know what you are doing\n\n2.  BOOKING A ROOM:\nWhen you get a room spend the extra money and get a Go Room.  Don't pay for the upgrade for the rooms with the crap fake wood floor.  A Go Room I say.  Don't pay for a suite unless you are already in a gambling mood.  Some can be great and others can look like an apartment circa 1972.  Getting a standard room is like asking for your room to smell of cat urine and vomit.  Again if you are in the gambling mood give it a whirl.  The Go Rooms are clean for the most part and modern.  Good shower and bed with an I pod docking station for listening to good jams before you go out.\n\n3.  CHECKING IN:\nThis can be a cluster mess of epic proportion if you allow it but follow this method and you will be good to go and laughing at the individuals in line for hours having a breakdown. We do this every year and have not had a problem yet.  First, DO NOT arrive at check in time and actually do not check in after 1pm ever.  Figure out a way to get there early.  Last year we tried to check in at 8am.  Of course we couldn't but that is not the point.  If you are flying to Vegas have the cab driver drop you off at the Valet and call over a bell hop.  If you drive to Vegas go to the Valet and call over a bell hop.  The bell hop will take your bags and give you a ticket.  First problem already solved.  Now you have just avoided being the people carrying their luggage through the hotel running into trash cans and small children along the way.  The people with their luggage on the Strip are hopeless so forget about them. Now you may be able to check in early for a small fee and if so great, you simply call down when you get to your room and your bags arrive and everybody is happy.  Now if you are like us and try to check in at 8am this is never going to work but what you will do is knock out everything that is needed with the front desk so when you come back at 3pm or whenever you go into a different line.  A few minutes an then you get your room key and are done because you have already completed the credit card/ID crap.  When you try and check in too early at the front desk they will point out this separate line for you to get in later in the day.\n\n4.  The POOL:  First of all RIP to the small pool which used to be the 21 and over pool and was topless at one time.  Nobody actually went topless, well a few people did but you get the idea.  So the large pool is 21 and up and the small pool is for families.  Families this hotel is really not the place for you.  You might think the location is great but I have about a million reasons why you should not stay here with the little ones. The Flamingo pool scene is good times and it is not the whole Encore pool scene vibe.  Get there early really early if you are the kind of person who wants a chair.  Remember this pool is also open to Bill's guest as well so the chairs fill up quick.  We usually pay the $200 and get the day bed for the day and there you have a home base to place your things, sit, lay or whatever you little heart desires.  It comes with a couple of free drinks or a bucket of beers.  You are in direct line for the booty shaking contest in the afternoon as well.  It is kind of cheesy but everyone is having a good time so just cheer for the brave girls who get up there and shake that thang.   The pool is big enough so although everyone is peeing it really does not effect you or at least me. I will say the vibe at the pool was a little weak this past year.  I thought the DJ just turned it to the local FM top 40 station and called it a day.  I am not trying to hate at all but the crowd did look a little rough around the edges.  You know what I am talking about.  Some really LARGE white people with their umbrella drink in one hand and a basket of whatever nasty mess they ordered at the snack shop in the other.  Still plenty of good looking people.  Hope this helps",1,1
"Eaten here a few times with groups and have never been real happy with it. Service has been terrible every time--they forget to bring things out that I've asked for, fill my green tea up with black tea when it's halfway down, and pick the tip up while I'm still at the table. All that has happened to me multiple times there. Just negligence. None of it is that awful, but there are so many better places for sushi, so why bother with this place? Also, their rice is almost always too dry. They never taste fresh, don't have anything original, and the service is bad. Seriously--why bother. Go to kabuki, sushi time, or Sakana.

"While in Vegas for a conference last week, my company treated us to dinner at SW Steakhouse and while the steaks were fantastic, the rest of the meal left us lacking.\n\nThe waiting area is extremely small and there are only about 6 stools in the bar, so large-ish groups like ours (5 at the time, 7 in total), can find themselves standing around for quite a bit.\n\nOnce seated, the service was extremely slow as we sat, ready to order but unattended to for at least fifteen minutes.  The wine that was recommended to us, although okay, was nothing special and, they only had two bottles, meaning we had to switch mid-way thorough the meal.  Every quality steakhouse I've ever been to has always notified us of a low inventory BEFORE serving the wine, especially when we've had a group of 5-7 people.  Not a major issue with SW but it just shows a lack of finesse, especially when paying a minimum of $54 for an a la carte steak.\n\nOn to the food...\n\nAs I mentioned, the steaks are FANTASTIC.  The veal chop that was ordered by a fellow diner also received rave reviews.  I had the smallest steak offered, a 9oz filet, cooked medium rare and it was cooked perfectly.  Another diner had the same steak only cooked medium well and his only (small issue) was that had specifically requested it be cooked with a thin line of pink and there was no pink at all.  But, he had zero complaints on the flavor or the texture - it was buttery and juicy and he thoroughly enjoyed it.  Rib-eyes were ordered by the rest of the table and all greatly enjoyed their steaks.\n\nAs with most (all?) high-end steakhouses, all sides are ordered a la carte.  At SW, the sides are $12 each with the sauteed wild mushrooms and grilled asparagus being the exception as they are $16 each.  All the sides are large enough to share but the potatoes gratin is quite small and unless everyone takes a very small portion, it would only serve 3.  And although the rest of the sides we ordered - creamed spinach, roasted mushrooms and black truffle creamed corn - were more than enough to serve all 7 of us, I have to wonder if that was due to the poor quality of the sides. No one went back for seconds on anything except the mushrooms. I can say that I highly recommend them,\n\nThe potatoes gratin came out lukewarm with the cheesy crust already solidified.  The potatoes were undercooked and we had to use a knife to remove the servings as the spoon was unable to cut through the hard potatoes.\n\nThe creamed spinach was not creamy. At all. It was all water without any of the normal creamy goodness that you expect to be clinging to the spinach.  It was swimming in water when it came to the table and once spooned on the plate, the water went everywhere, affecting all the servings on the plate.\n\nThe black truffle creamed corn was just weird. The black truffle, of which I am normally a HUGE fan, was just misplaced here.  It was almost like an afterthought and simply added to attempt to validate $12 for a $3 dish.  The corn itself was just mush. There were no kernels of plump, sweet corn and in mid-summer, the height of corn season, that's just sacrilege. \n\nThe grilled asparagus were thick and perfectly grilled and perhaps with a seafood dish they would have been more well received.  Or in hindsight, squeezing some fresh lemon on them would have probably made a world of difference.  Their charred smokey flavor too closely resembled that of the steaks and therefore they didn't have any real oomph of their own.  A drizzle of  Hollandaise would have also given them their own identity. \n\nAll in all, I would not go back here again unless invited (and paid for) by someone else.  Cut by Wolfgang Puck will be my next LV steakhouse adventure.  If invited back to SW again, I would at least make sure that we had a table with a view of the Lake of Dreams show. The little peeks that we were able to catch from the corner of our table were very impressive.",0,0
"\u00e9 by Jose Andres\nFebruary 8, 2012 - 8:30PM\n\nGeneral Fine-Dining Disclaimer: Many people do not understand that most (if not all) upscale restaurants do not pile a ton of food on your plate. A diner should appreciate the finest flavors orchestrated into smaller dishes, which is how we received our servings. If you're looking for places that serve up large piles of food and multiple napkins, kindly skip my reviews. \n\nEater.com says that this hidden restaurant is one of the hardest reservations to get. All we did to get them was email the website *exactly* one month in advance and wait. In fact, we waited a week without word but were able to secure a reservation for the requested night. They also explained that they are very busy (as you can imagine) and they are almost always booked solid.\n\nOnce you secure your reservations, you'll get a pair of Golden tickets (just like Willy Wonka) by mail. If you live farther than the East Coast, you probably won't get it in time for the event. But they'll still let you in.\n\nOn the night of dinner, get there at least 15 minutes in advance. Have one of Jose's signature Ultimate Gin and Tonics because it really is the ultimate.\n\nTip: Ask the head chef for permission to take pictures as a courtesy. You will be allowed to but you cannot take video (a shame) or use a flash (also a shame, because it's dim in there). When they begin their choreographed assembly of each disk (and I wonder how often they practice), you'll see that flash photography would interfere with their procedures.\n\nEight seats. Twenty three dishes. Wine supplements were skipped. Nearly all were consumed in two bites.\n\n\nGin & Tonic\nSpanish Clavel\nBeet Jewelry\nCaramelized Pork Rinds\nApple \""""Brazo de Gitano\""""\nNitro Almond Cup\nCrispy Chicken Skin in Escabeche\nJos\u00e9 Taco\nOlive Sferica Ferran Adria (Spherical Olives!!)\nBocata de \""""Calamares\""""\nCava Sangria\n\nArtichoke Puree w/ Vanilla\nLobster with Citrus and Jasmine\nChickpea Stew with Ib\u00e9rico Ham\nTurbot with Bone Marrow - GF's favorite dish\nRosemary Wild Mushrooms in Papillote\nSecreto of Ib\u00e9rico Pork with Squid\n\nOrange Pith Pur\u00e9e La Serena\nFlan\nPan Con Chocolate\n\""""Arroz Con Leche\""""\nFizzy Paper\n25 Second Bizcocho\n\""""Air\"""" Chocolates\n\nLet's face it - you'll be overwhelmed in no time. How do you keep track of each dish *and* take pictures of each? Not easy.\n\nEach dish is composed with fine detail and precision, and Chef Brett took time to describe each (after they were handed to each guest). He also answered any/all questions from the guests while we ate.\n\nOur favorite dishes were:\n\nFried Bone Marrow - Possibly the greatest flavor I've ever experienced. The GF lost her mind over this also.\n\nFried Chicken Skin w/ Oysters and Caviar - If you love chicken skin,  this will rock your world. Two bites.\n\nAt the end of dinner, you will be assigned a unique diner's number based on the total number of diners to date. You will then be asked to sign a personal note to Jose in a small book that others have done previously.\n\nThe bill came out to $540-something for two including tip. This was the finest display of molecular gastronomy I've ever experienced. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!",1,0
"I had an amazing 4 course meal here with my family from philadlephia. my father runs a farmers market there and was very impressed with their use of seasonal and local foods. We had an amazing pork belly salad and I had duck wrapped in bacon and stuffed with pate, which sounds insanely heavy, but it was not; the portion was small enough not to be overwhelmed and it was not overly greasy at all. It was a fantastic meal. I think l'etoile is on par with top restaurants in bigger cities.",1,1
"We went here for a girls night out dinner. We ordered 4 different dishes and all of us commented that all of our dishes were very salty (sea bass, duck, swordfish). \n\nThe service was mediocre- the waitress lacked emotions and her voice was so quiet we could barely hear her the whole time. \n\nAs for the sides, the waitress asked \""""what would you like for your side?\"""" to all of us, and we thought they were included in the meal. Later when we got the bill, we found out that the sides were about $10 each. No complaints, they probably will say \""""it's your fault for not looking at the prices on the menu\"""" but we felt that she should've asked instead of sounding like she's offering sides.\n\nThe restaurant does have a romantic vibe though- the interior was nice.\n\nHowever for a $250 bill without any drinks and 4 very salty dishes, I wouldn't come back.",0,0
"Room: We were put in a room on the 3rd floor all the day at the end of the hallway facing the highway. I am pregnant and a light sleeper and that wasn't gonna suffice.  So I called the front desk where they told me my only other option was a 2 queen bed room, no more kings.  Hard to believe because the resort seemed deserted.  But we took it.  That was annoying. \nAlso, in both rooms we were in, the mini bar price list was completely out of date.  There were several items on both mini bars that were not even listed on the list.  I wanted these items but had no idea I would be bogusly charged for them so I didn't indulge.  Disappointing. \nThe powering washing each night of the pool area, VERY obnoxious.  Can this not be done after the pool closes when everyone is at dinner?  1. I could hear it from our room when we went to bed early. 2. The next night we went to the hot tub and they were power washing all around us and it was very obnoxious and loud.  Terrible. \nNext, the steakhouse experience.  VERY disappointed in how that turned out. \nAlso, our last morning my husband went down to starbucks to get my an ice water.  He also ordered himself a coffee but he forgot his ID/wallet because he was just going to do a room charge.  We stayed at The Aria the 2 nights prior to coming here and didn't need our ID's for the room charges.  So we weren't used to it.  Well he didn't have his ID so he just asked them for the water for his pregnant wife and to forget the coffee.  They said no because the water was $.27, not free.  Are you kidding me?!  The resort can't spare $.27 as a courtesy to this EXTREME INCONVENIENCE after  a 10-15 minute round trip walk?  So he had to walk all the way back up to our room for his ID just to get me water.  He even asked if he could txt me and ask me to send a picture of his ID to show the cashier and he said no.  How absurd.  All for $.27 for the pregnant lady.",0,0
Dr. Taylor is just an  amazing dentist and his staff is  just as phenomenal as he is. Elaine is quite the  dental hygienist! The office is beautiful and everyone makes you feel comfortable and at home.   Who likes going to the dentist? I can honestly say now  I absolutely love the dentist and look forward to the appointments that I have with Dr. Taylor.   Don't waste your time going anywhere else and make an appointment as soon as you can!   The service is extraordinary and the quality of dentistry is unmatched.,1,1

"I would have given this place 3 stars based on a handful of visits, cool decor and some interesting swing-seats. It seems like a good place for a date, although from what I remember it was a bit pricey.\n\nI've thought about returning, until I heard that the bar management thinks jokes about domestic abuse are a good way to sell drinks and bring in business. Now I KNOW there is no need for me to return. Sexism and misogyny are bad for business.",0,0
"A last minute Sunday night decision on where to eat turned out to be a delightful dinner. We grabbed another couple and decided just to try a different pizza place. I did a UrbanSpoon search and found some good reviews out in Lake Las Vegas. There house wines were great and reasonably priced and we could of made a meal on their soup. Some combination of a bunch of vegetables, but really tasty. Never did end up with a pizza, cause their specials sounded delicious and they were. Take the ride. Worth it. Oh yeah, Migel, our waiter...long pony tail and a fabulous personality.",1,1
"I  have never been to a restaurant with better customer service.  The staff at this location are out of this world.  The food is amazing as well.  Everytime we go we have had delicous prime rib and sirloins.  Happy hour is a great time to test it out, but you wouldn't be disappointed for dinner.  We love going during the week on Monday or Tuesday when it isn't very busy.",1,1
"I adore each location I have been to.  I truly wish this location had not moved from its place on Hayden Road (as it was so close to my home), but I do hope the foot traffic is better for their sake.\n\nThe selection is amazing. I can spend hours smelling each mix and pondering what I want to cook next.  I have successfully replaced every spice and herb in my cabinet with a Penzy's version, and I am so happy that I did.  \n\nYou will not be disapointed.",1,1
"The Hub is a well established events venue, which is owned by the Edinburgh International Festival, and also includes a cafe, called Cafe Hub (keeping it real) and a ticket office. The Hub is housed in a really striking renovated church building near the top of the Royal Mile, and is a pretty clear landmark for anyone trying to navigate their way around the Old Town.\n\nI've been to the Assembly Hall upstairs in the Hub, plus another one of the smaller rooms for an arts event, and they both provided a pleasant atmosphere for socialising and relaxing. The interior of the Hub is bright and modern, in contrast to the gothic exterior of the building. The cafe comes well recommended, with its selection of hearty breakfast and lunch options, all at inexpensive prices.",1,0
"Here's a sample experience at MacAlpines:\n\nWow! A real, old fashioned soda parlor! Whoa, look at all this vintage stuff! Hey, check out the menu!

"Great happy hour specials with all wines at half price, appetizers at half price and flatbreads at half price.  The wine list was a full page and included all the wines; not just house wines at some places.  I have had better bruschetta at Postino's but the flatbreads were good for sharing.\n\nIf a lot of people showed up there would be a definite space problem on the inside. There is a half booth and three half booths with two chairs each in the bar area.  The bar itself is square with more than a dozen cushioned bar chairs.  \n\nOne could eat on the outside but who in his \""""right\"""" mind would want to sit on the patio very long in the never ending summer heat,,, yeah sure, it is a dry heat but not for long...",1,0
"Very easy and convenient process.  Everyone was polite, professional and had terrific work ethic.  They do fantastic work on both chips and full replacement (I have used them for both).  The entire staff is sincere and made sure I was taken care of with my insurance company as well.",1,1

"My partner and I just left and were disgusted by our experience. It's not often I harshly critique a restaurant, but this restaurant deserves to have its reputation tarnished. We walked in shortly after 5 PM on a Saturday evening and were initially greeted and shown to our booth. I have never before sampled Indian fare (and never will after this experience) so I was extremely excited to try it. I was prepared to shell out quite a bit of cash to have an all-out authentic Indian cuisine experience to try to cap off an early Valentine's Day date, yet we ended up paying $24 for two half-plates of terrible food. After sitting at our booth for ten minutes (the restaurant was NOT crowded) we just assumed it was buffet-styled only and went to each grab a plate. I had no idea what anything was and just tried to sample a small bit of everything. The food was barely warm, wasn't seasoned (isn't Indian food supposed to be spicy?), and there wasn't any naan, which my partner told me was tasty bread. \n\nAfter being grossed out by our food my partner asked if there was a way we could receive menus and order food from them instead. The server proceeded to ignore his inquiry. He discussed just leaving without paying in total disgust for the lack of service and awful food, but we promptly paid and left. For what it's worth we watched as another larger group walked in behind us and were approached at their table and asked if they wanted the buffet or to see a menu. I have half a mind to suspect we were treated so rudely due to our sexual orientation. \n\nIn seeing the reviews below if THIS is what you Pittsburghers consider to be great food then you obviously lack any sense of culinary expertise. I would love to thank India Garden for ruining my first foray into Indian cuisine along with our Valentine's Day.",0,0
"NOTE: Our stay could have been an entirely different experience had we not booked a stay the weekend after a Livingsocial.com deal was made available.  We did not buy that deal, we were regular customers...\n\nOk, starting at the beginning.  \n\n- Check-in is 4:00pm.  We got there at 3:50pm, arrived to a line of no less than 30 people.  NO rooms were available for us.  They temporarily checked us in and said we could go to the water park and call back in an hour to see if a room was ready... but, the only place to change was at the Athletic Club clear on the opposite side of the park.  By the time we hiked over there and back it was 5pm.  Our room wasn't ready until 6:40 (we called about 5 times until they finally had one ready.)  \n\n- The room was HOT.  It was on the top floor and really never cooled down, even after we removed a gross, dirty air filter (I'll be posting a picture in case you're into looking at icky stuff.)  If you're one of those people who likes it very quiet to sleep, top floor is bad.\n\n- Also, on the noise topic, our bathtub dripped so bad it sounded like the faucet was on a slow trickle the whole time.  Water wasters!  Side note, the bathroom was so small you had to step out of the way to shut the door.  A large person might need to step into the tub to shut the door. :(\n\n- Gross... there were several places of STICKY on the carpeting.  2 were right in places where normal people put their feet all the time so that was annoying and nobody should have been in that room until that was cleaned (but they were completely sold out because of the LivingSocial.com deal.)\n\n- The railings along the walkways to our room seem 'flimsy' to an acrophobe like me.  If you have small children, or rowdy older kids, you might ask for a room on a different floor.  A lower floor, closer to the ground... safer.\n\n- The Oasis water park was ok, but the staff had no continuity.  One person would allow a 47\"""" child to ride the slide, another wouldn't.  One day they didn't care if your floats were by your seats while you ate lunch, the next day they were collecting them just for getting out of the water.  And so on and so forth...  And any time you get a bunch of people staying at a resort they wouldn't normally be able to afford, you're going to get a class of people that are... sub-par.  We saw at least 2 instances of people just taking other peoples chaises, even when they clearly had their personal stuff (shoes, shirts) stored there.  There was considerable pushing and shoving to get in the water, lots of unsupervised, rude 8-12 year old kids.  All of this was a nuisance that probably is not a regular issue.\n\n\n\nTHE HOTEL DID TRY TO MAKE RIGHT BY US.  We only complained about having to wait for a room for so long and they ended up cutting our hotel rate in half (which was then less than those LivingSocial.com folks) and giving us vouchers for drinks (6) and enough vouchers to cover our lunch (for 6 people.)  So they were aware of how screwed up things were.  We didn't complain about the room or the park as it was so incredibly busy it didn't seem worth it.",0,0
"Don't go here for the food.  The atmosphere and bar are very nice.  However, the food is flavorless.  The menu also mentions that most food can be cooked in 4 or 5 minutes, which is interesting since with a half full restaurant, we still waited 30 minutes for our food.  We had the Peppercorn Crust Burger (blah), Roasted Chicken Sandwich (blah), Roasted Sweet Potato fritters (so so) and scalloped potatoes (left half on the plate they were so good).  There are so many other places in Phoenix that serve a better \""""gourmet\"""" burger in a similar environment -- Fez, and Zinburger come to mind.",0,1
"First of all, let me say that they would have gotten 3 stars, but I took one star off for price.\n\nWe came in famished and buzzed around 12 AM.  Lousy 6 hour drive to vegas thanks to traffic.\n\nOur server appeared kinda slow.  At first I thought he was stoned because he spoke slowly and incoherently but he was okay for the most part...just a little slow with the check/he didn't stop by our table very often.  \n\nFood.  We started off with the buffalo wings, which I thought were okay.  Some were a bit small.\n\nI asked for the Hawaiian rib eye, and he said they were out.  in fact they were out of all steak except for the filet mignion.  wtf?  i like my steak w/ a bit of chew, and yea i know rib eye is a bit soft too, but i was tempted by the hawaiian part.  instead i opted for the Jamaican jerk pork chops.  very large side of steamed vegetables.  baked potato (hard to mess that up).  pork chops said they were marinated, but sure as hell didn't taste like it.  more like the grill with a bit of spices sprinkled on.  still it was cooked well, and wasn't dry.  two small but fat pieces of chops.\ni thought it was mediocre food at a high price (20 bucks for the chops).  it'd be better to go some place else, but i was staying here, and that was the only place open at the time.  \n\nbut i was buzzed and hungry so i ate it all up.  their fries were good.\nhad the 10% off coupon i got when i checked in.\n\nall in all, if you don't want to read what i wrote: overpriced mediocre food.  go eat at somewhere cheaper, and then play what you saved at a blackjack table.  21!\n\nopen 24 hours, like most casino cafes",0,1

"So this is just a d\u00e9panneur corner store where you can pick up a pop and some smokes or whatever, but what is special about it is the beer selection. Rows of local and imported microbrews i.e. deliciousness. Downstairs is a video store which, in this day and age, must make like 0 dollars, so hopefully they will expand their knowledgable and tasty collection of brews and make this place beer lover heaven (beer emporium!)\n\nThe second thing worth noting about this sweet brightly lit shop is that the woman who works here (and is the owner I believe) is hilarious. She has a great dry, sarcastic sense of humour that gets me every time, and she's quick to let me know when a beer I'm looking at on the floor is available cold in the fridge instead.

I can't say that it was necessarily a \""""light\"""" lunch, but it was delicious.\n\nThe ambience is really fun, and we sat in a table toward the back of the restaurant where we had plenty of space to relax and unwind after a morning filled with shopping and walking. Our server suggested the Southside to start, and I was intrigued. They only make 15 large jars per day of this drink, so I decided to take advantage of this special drink. It's just beefeater, fresh lemon juice, and mint. Super delicious. Super refreshing. Of course I ordered a second drink. My friend had the pub's version of a moscow mule, and loved it. \n\nWe shared the fried pickles, which were perfectly crispy and not greasy at all, and our server recommended the Greek salad and I was requesting \""""lighter\"""" fare.

"I looked up this restaurant hoping for a close approximation of Malaysian cuisine. The place is located in an active, mixed use area that is pedestrian friendly and a largely student/ hippy population. \nThe decor is trying to be Thai and the music was a horrible medley of obscure cover versions.\nI ordered the Achat, a refreshing pickled salad, served cold (a little too sweet for my taste), and the potato-chicken curry. The curry sauce and potatoes were excellent, although there was too much dark chicken meat and not enough potatoes.\nMy partner who is vegetarian got a vegetable soup in a dark, salty, soy\nbased broth that was bland but palatable. \nWe paid about 40$, which in my opinion was too much for an unremarkable meal I could have ordered at any old Thai restaurant.

The is probably one the worst places to eat.  \n\nAs i walked into this place I assumed it was going to be a good resturant to eat at.  The resturant was big and clean.  \n\nMy family of 4 ordered 3 Pho Dac Biet and one Bun Chao Tom (grilled shimp past with noodles).  When our Pho came out it was warm.  It wasn't hot enough to cook the raw meat then put on top of pho.   The worst part of the meal was when the Bun Chao Tom.   As we were slicing into the meat we discovery that it was still cold.  We were completely disgusted at this point.  We paid and left.  We will never return to this place again.,0,0

I can't really comment on the quality of the yogurt because being vegan my options are limited so I was only able to try the two but they were good to me, this will be a regular spot for me and my son so I hope in the future they will offer more dairy free options, I would love a vanilla or more sorbet options! They have a lot of toppings available including boba, which is my favorite. The atmosphere is great, very nice little spot, I hope they stick around!",1,1
"A steakhouse is a steakhouse is a steakhouse.\n\nA Las Vegas Strip steakhouse is a great steakhouse is an expensive steakhouse. \n\nYes, the beef was very fine. The doneness was spot on. The mushrooms were delish. The cocktails were perfect. The bill was exorbitant. Yadda yadda yadda. That can be said for just about any steakhouse on the Strip (and I've been to several).\n\nWhat sets the Old Homestead Steakhouse apart and will make us repeat diners is the wonderful service we received that made our evening.\n\nWe stopped by here after being told there was an hour-and-a-half long wait at Mesa Grill. The hostess remembered us from the night before (we had tried to stop for a nightcap the previous night, but were told by the assistant manager that they were closed). She said there were cancellations and she could seat us immediately. Nice. We were shown to a table, brought bread and water right away, and told that our server would be Kevin. \n\nKevin turned out to be one of those industry pros, he'd been a server with the Caesar's restaurant for 30-some years. We took to him immediately as he matched our mood and temperament, and was happy to chat with us and give us the time and interaction we were looking for, even though he had at least two other large parties he was taking care of. The smallest of gestures caught his eye. He anticipated our needs. He was there with a hot finger towels after I was done gnawing on the bone of our NY steak. \n\nA quick note on the steaks - they had some interesting bone-in cuts you don't usually find at other steakhouses. The bone-in filet is on my bucket list.\n\nThe assistant manager came by at one point to apologize again for having to turn us away last night and thank us for coming back and giving the restaurant another change. \n\nWe had to commend Kevin to the manager, Perry, who was very gracious and gave us his number for future reservations. Kevin said he'd make sure we got a better table next time too, although I didn't think there was anything wrong with the table we had. We didn't have dessert, as nothing in particular appealed to me and dinner was quite satisfying already. So we finished with port and scotch instead and I had the hankering for a bit of chocolate to go with my scotch. Kevin came to the rescue again, bringing me some dark chocolate curls that hit the spot. \n\nThe Old Homestead treated us like regulars even though it was only our first time there. I think there is something to be said for a steakhouse or any restaurant that can make you feel that way on a first visit :)",1,1
"Excellent team of doctors. I highly recommend American Family Dentistry. I have been to many dentists around the valley, some very scarring experiences, & some first time appointments that I never did wind up scheduling a second. American family dentist is tried & true. Dr Lida D. Raoufi is beyond amazing - I have never met a doctor so warm, & nurturing while drilling holes in my teeth! & the dental assistants are such pros! They definitely know their stuff. Great, great staff.\n\n\nThe only reason I am giving four stars, is because unfortunately I had a couple root canals done here - however their referral to the doctor who managed to complete the procedure was lacking in skill. Years later I am now having problems, & am having to pay thousands more (even with insurance!) to get medicine put in it, drilled, & then re-done. If they would have been highly skilled in the first place - this wouldn't have even been necessary. I had also told the male doctor on staff about this problem - as I wasn't sure what it was looking like below the surface, but it was bothering me. & he didn't even bother to check it out. It was an obvious problem, as I was feeling it internally - then 5 year X-rays come & there is a TOTALLY apparent problem that easily could have been checked out, possibly corrected with less invasive techniques.",1,0
"If you ever come here you must sit outside and enjoy the poolside view, even if its a little hot, you wont reget it.\n\nMy boyfriend and I came for lunch after checking into encore.

If you get the salad, there is no need to add meat, because honestly they dont give you that much for the extra price and the salad itself is savory. \n\nThe sliders were good, typical sliders nothing really special about them, I guess you're better off ordering a burger for the same price as the sliders.\n\nOMGOSH the truffle fries were SO GOOd!!! Definitely would order these again! There were freshly made a d had truffle sauce and cheese over it. So bad for you but ooooo so good.\n\nOver all the prices seemed a little steep, but it is vegas so what do you expect. The serve was good, they seemed really busy but they were attentive.",1,1
"My fianc\u00e9 and I spent $175 each on really sweet tickets, and were very excited to see this show.  We had dinner at SWITCH at the Wynn which was excellent, and then headed to MGM Grand for our 9:30pm showtime.  \n\nPerks:  They serve 32 oz alcoholic beverages.  I got some peach smoothie something or another which was delicious.  The vertical stage was pretty neat, but you can only watch people fall off it so many times before that gets old too.\n\nDisappointments: Everything else.  The show was SOOOO boring.  I was ready to be amazed and in awe and not wanting it to end.  Instead Jon and I found ourselves looking at each other wondering when the cool effects and acrobatics happened.  We ended up leaving after an hour and ten minutes.  We just couldn't take it any more.  The straw that broke the camels back was when there were crabs and starfish running around the stage.  This isn't Disney World for kids, this is Vegas people.  So awful.\n\nDefinitely do NOT see this show.  It's just as expensive as O, Mystere, Love, and Le Reve, so see one of those where you are sure to leave happy!",0,0
"This is a pretty nice place-\nIt is reasonably priced and the service was very good, so were the drinks.\nI ordered the salmon and it tasted very good, although it was a little dry.\nThe atmosphere was very nice, although the restaurant is very small inside.\nThis means that there isn't much room between the tables, hence I could hear the conversation held by everyone near me.\n\nOtherwise a very good place, would definitely recommend it to others.",1,1
"As we were at the Montelucia resort for the night we figured we would check out their 'Slow Movement' restaurant Prado. Well slow service just what we received. The place was busy (not jammed) and the waiters just couldn't cope, The service was painfully slow and our guy was frankly jaded. He said all the right things but you didn't believe a word of it.\n\nI had some delicious scallops but with polenta that was essentially fancy grits. I have tasted much better elsewhere. I went on to lamb for my entree which was OK, but again just OK. \n\nTo top off the evening our red wine was served at room temperature and I mean Arizona with no AC room temperature! Not good. \n\nI would pass on this place and if you are staying at the otherwise excellent resort. Jump in a cab and head to the nearby excellent Tarbells on Camelback Road.",0,0

Itemized, on a notepad, what exactly we were paying for a month.\n3. Analyzed the demographics of our minute usage. What we used most vs. What we used less. \n4.

"Amazing subs- so glad they opened this location. The service is great, the food is awesome, the hot sauces are delicious, the coke machine is fun- I really enjoy eating here and I look forward to repeat visits. Every other sub place pales in comparison, except Capriotti's, but they have their own special thing going on, so I don't really compare the two.\n\nBy the way, the #10 with the Datil sauce is fantastic!! My other favorite is the #5, just as it is. YUM!",1,1
"I FLAT REFUSE TO STEP FOOT IN WinCo Foods for as long as I am residing in Las Vegas. I went in today and trouble began from the second I pulled into the lot. The parking spaces on the North side had broken glass all over the place and with traffic behind me I had to drive through it. Not cool. Then after getting a space I can't even get to the door because the hordes of people are gawking at a Henderson PD Parking Enforcement officer who was circling like a vulture waiting to write tickets. Once inside I had a foot run over by a shopping cart and in the bulk foods section I had 2 different people ram me in the derriere with a cart in under 90 seconds. Hello? I'm 6'4 and wearing a red shirt. It's not like they couldn't see me! I know I'm not a small guy. But I'm trying to lose weight so having a steel shopping cart attached to my rear is not going to help me any. \n\nSo after extracting myself from the shopping carts of mayhem I head over to the deli counter. I ask them a simple question about the source of their meats and I get the classic I don't have a clue shrug. Ugh! After fighting the madhouse to get through the rest of the store for what I need I finally get up to the front to check out. I have 16 items...I thought it was 15, my bad. Self check out is for 15 items..it's posted on the overhead sign. I get in line and next thing I know I have some woman counting my items and saying I have 1 too many. Fine, I take an item out of the cart and set it to the side and she's like sorry, you have to go to another line. I tell her I now have 15 items, she's like you need to go to another line. At that point I'm at thermonuclear launch mode (this is ultra rare for me) and I'm like this is ridiculous. I raise my voice and tell her and a lot of others in earshot: Let me tell you how I'm going to save at WinCo...I'm leaving, and I WON'T BE BACK! On my way out the door a couple that saw what happened said good for me, that I did the right thing. Not that I needed the validation but still...enough is enough. \n\nMaybe when someone carves a replica of the Taj Mahal in ice in Hell, Michigan will I ever step foot in that store again. 1 star, and a bump to the EEK! I THINK NOT / Worst of Las Vegas list and an email to WinCo Corporate is my response. \n\nFor the sake of readability I've left out even more bad things that happened on this trip...don't even get me started on the bakery! Ugh!",0,0
"Our first visit to Remington's was on a recent weeknight.  We made reservations but they certainly were not needed as the dining room was nearly empty.  By contrast the bar lounge area was rather busy.  A piano and lounge singer could be heard into the dining room, kind of a nice background that we did enjoy.  Others have raved about this being a classy place.  I sure didn't get that vibe.  It was more 80's dated hotel restaurant than classy to me.\n\nWe had a very attentive waiter who served us well.  There seemed to be a lot of servers with a lot of busy acitivty, constantly in and out of swinging doors.  There was a large group in a private closed off dining area.  We noticed most patrons were in their Senior years.  Maybe they alternate between here and Charleston's?\n\nBetween us we ordered steak & grilled salmon with a potato dish to share and a couple of side salads.  The steak was not cooked as requested but we didn't bother to send it back.  Salmon was unremarkable.  The tomato mozzarella salad was abundant but yellow tomatoes were inedible mush and the red tomatoes were just flavorless.  Lyonnaise potatoes were a tad greasy.  Dinners are all ala carte.  Nothing was particularly bad, just nothing to get excited about.  I felt like I was dining in a hotel restaurant, food was delivered with plastic covers like they use in room service dining.  \n\nOverall I have to say I was simply underwhelmed.  After reading other reviews I had greater expectations for Remington's.  At a total of $84 (no alcohol) we expected more.  If I were a hotel guest on an expense account, maybe I would have felt differently. For the money, next time I would drive just down the street and go to Ruth's Chris.  We won't be hurrying back to Remington's.",0,0
Our driver got us to the airport safely in an ice storm.  Wouldn't have made it without him.  Thanks Michael!  We will use again and again!,1,1

"I was not impressed.  The food was not very flavorful.  The location and atmosphere are the best things about this restaurant, but they are not creating this food with an eye toward being a gourmet restaurant.\nI am a little disturbed by a reviewer who wrote that the owners contacted her in a harassing way after a negative review.  I hope that is not going to be repeated.",0,0
The music in the back is good. That is the only plus of this place though. The drinks are meh. Also the biggest let down is my fault at the beginning but their terrible service in the end. I forgot my card one night and when coming back the next day they had closed the tab and gave my card back with no receipt or record of how much they charged. I did not sign or anything. Now I have to go back through the statement and see exactly what they charged me for and for how much. Huge let down and will not go back.,0,0
"This place has a lot of rules:\n1. You cannot wait inside if there are no seats available, even though when you go inside there is plenty of standing space near the ATM.  There is not standing at the bar, or around the tables.\n2. If you have a party more than 4, and you want to split a check per what you ordered, this will not be accommodated.  You will have to split it evenly.  This got very awkward for my group of friends because we all ordered very different things.  Luckily some of our party had cash so the four of us that didn't could pay for what we bought.\n3. They do not take reservations between 4 and 8pm\n4. There is a $10 minimum for a card charge, but luckily the drinks are $9-11 dollars, so you should be ok.\n\nI've been here twice.  Once was on a Thursday around 7pm.  We were told we couldn't have a reservation till after 8.  When I arrived at 7, the place was empty and luckily they sat us.  The second time was last Saturday (labor day weekend) and we were told it was a 2 hour wait for a cocktail... not dinner... so we went to another bar in cityscape.\n\nSo the first time I was able to actually get in was ok.  The drink menu is fun.  Tons of options and there was a fantastic graph on the back to help guide you if you wanted something exciting, sweet, traditional, or savory.  My cocktails were great, no complaints.  I was really excited to have a fun, new, cocktail place in phoenix so things were looking up.\n\nThe food menu has some left to be desired, but if you treat this as a place to get a drink vs. getting dinner, then you'll be fine.  The food was good though, just not a great variety. \n1.  I had the patte with bread, very yummy.\n2.  The Ramen Burger... well that was disappointing.  Yes, it says that there is a lot of sauce on it (\""""extra napkins\""""), but it really did over power the burger.  I could barely taste the beef or the ramen... really they acted like conduits for the sauce which wasn't that memorable.  \n3. My plain fries, a side that is separate, were really good.  I would like to have a cocktail and these fries every time I come here.\n3.  The loaded friends looked really good and my friends enjoyed them\n\nWe all liked being there, and I wanted to go back and introduce other friends to bitter and twisted (hence last Saturday) but they just make it too hard.  Also considering there is the blue hound, arrogant butcher and squid ink in walking distance (all have great cocktails and food).\n\nI will try to come back again, I just hope they accommodate customers a little better.",0,1
"A solid 3.5 stars (I'm Korean and was raised in L.A.,  so my standards are pretty high).  Like Mexican and Chinese food, good Korean food is another thing that is hard to come by in the Valley (near Tempe).  The only places that I think are even worth mentioning are: Chodang, Hodori, and Takamatsu.  All three have their pros and cons.  I have posted separate reviews of Chodang and Takamatsu.  Besides going to Chodang and Takamatsu for specific reasons, Hadori is where my husband and I go if we have unspecified hankerings for Korean food.  They have a wide range of offerings and they are all pretty good, and my husband likes their BBQ the best.",1,1
"Beautiful pop up wedding. The chapel was so helpful and gracious. The flowers were beautiful, the photographer was awesome. Cake pops were yummy. The the Wicked Spoon was awesome for our family. The hotel suite was gorgeous with views of the Bellagio fountains. Lastly, the concierge made everything extra special. Loved the rock shows too.",1,1
"Dropped by for dinner before heading upstairs to the club portion of the establishment.\n\nWe ordered waaaaayyy too much food, which was fine by me since it was my last night in Vegas on this trip.  Might as well go out with a bang right? \n\nAnyways, some highlights of the meal included the following:\n\n-Spicy tuna on crispy rice\n-Lobster wontons\n-Sea bass skewers\n-Toro sashimi\n-Salmon sashimi\n-Mini donuts for desert\n\nThe thing that amazed me about this place is that the food is worth eating.  The dining room is a scene AND it is enormous.  It is quite a feat that the kitchen is able to keep up with the dining room considering how large it is.  And given the people watching here, some restaurants might try to get away with the fact that their dining room is filled with a large number of scantily clad women.  Tao avoids that trap and serves up some pretty tasty Asian dishes and has the service to see that it gets served right.",1,1
"This was only my first time here, but I'm a fan already.  I think I need to make Donut Mondays a tradition so it sucks less to drive into Crafton for work.\n\nI got an Elvis donut: bacon-maple frosting on top of a banana-cream-filled donut.  It was heavenly, though a little sweet.  I'd like to have some actual pieces of bacon sprinkled on top to add a little saltiness or some dark chocolate to cut the sweetness.  The dough itself was light and the perfect combo of crunchy/crisp exterior with a light, heavenly inside.  I wonder if that's how the Crafton Angel donut got her name.  I didn't actually look at the menu boards to see the full offering, but there were also Danish pastries and muffins in the case.  The price is also reasonable ($8/dozen?!) though they're well worth more than that.\n\nThe woman behind the counter was so friendly and there was a gentleman sitting at the counter (yep, a counter, like a true diner) who was a regular customer.  Both were pleasant and I would have stayed to chat longer and actually look at the menu, but my work schedule would not allow the chit-chat.  Maybe next time I can get here earlier - they're open 10pm to 3 pm the next day (usually 24 hours, but the weather got in the way of that).\n\nAlso - is it doughnut or donut?  I insist on the latter.",1,1

"As fans of small business in general, and as a local business owner myself, my wife and I could not wait for Va Da Vie to open. The fact that they were setting up inside the Park Road Shopping Center, a favorite area of ours since we are only 1 mile up the road, was just a huge plus. For the past 8 weeks I have made it my mission to introduce everyone in my office to VaDaVie and even have made sure to make a stop for gelato a must when relatives have been in town. Usually I can count on the smiling face and warm greeting from the male owner which has more than made up for the cold shoulder you get from the female owner who is always there. \n\nTonights experience turned the usual cold shoulder and kicked it up a few notches as my wife walked in past 8:00pm (8:12pm to be exact) as the door was still open and there were still people in line ordering and two women sitting enjoying their gelato inside; just what a new small business would like right?! Instead she received a very snarky \""""I better lock the door or else people will just keep coming in\"""" from the female owner followed by the comment \""""well I'm not going to turn you away now\"""" after my wife asked if she should leave. WOW!, what a reception to give when you are trying to start up a small business! What a problem to have, people lining out the door to buy some of your product and they are greeted with this poor attitude?!\n\nGreat gelato but will not return based on the principle. From one small business owner to another; this is not the way to build a successful business.",0,0
"No complaints and we'll go back again for further exploration.  The kitchen menu is pretty interesting.  I like a sushi place that has other items that are easy to peruse and choose.  We had the salmon with sweet corn and loved it.  Eager to work our way through the other kitchen items.  The sushi was fine;  it didn't blow my mind but it was very good and honestly, it's nice to have a sushi place right in the middle of it all.  This is a very welcome and classy addition to Desert Ridge, right by the theater, (and good riddance to lame old San Felipes.)",1,1
"Subways is Subways, and they generally all taste the same consistently and have pretty decent quality ingredients. The reason for the low rating at this particular location is because of our server. He was very rushed, brusque, and stingy when it came to any of the add-ons. \n\nNot sure if it was this location that was stingy or if it was just the server. I had to ask three times for more bell peppers because he barely put any on each time, and just didn't bother with the rest of the ingredients or we'd be there for a while. \n\nHe also dropped something behind the counter at one point and picked it up to throw away without changing his gloves as he went back to prepare food. Since I didn't see what it was or where/how he picked it up I decided to give him the benefit of the doubt.",0,0
"The Roaring Fork was a pleasant surprise. After finding out that the restaurant we wanted to eat at had closed down, we decided to try the Roaring Fork. I had looked at the menu earlier that day online and wasn't that impressed so I wasn't expecting much. But I was pleasantly surprised. The food was delicious, the service was great and we were seated right away, no reservations needed. The prices were very reasonable too.\n\nI had the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin which our server recommended. It was so good. The smokiness of the bacon offset the sweet corn perfectly. The cheesy grits on bottom added a nice creaminess to the dish. All the flavors complimented each other. I usually don't like pork tenderloin that much (I'm more of a beef, lamb, wild game or seafood kind of gal), but this dish changed my mind about pork tenderloin. It can be juicy and delicious! My son had the rainbow trout which was delicious and cooked perfectly. Hubby got the 22oz bone in ribeye steak which was huge and cooked a perfect medium rare. It was juicy and flavorful. He also got a side of the jalape\u00f1o mac 'n cheese which good too. \n\nDefinitely worth checking out if you are ever in Scottsdale!",1,1
"I love the idea of loving this place.  I really do.  And to be honest, if I was reviewing this place on it's own merits and not the clientele - I'd probably give it 3 stars as it delivers what it promises.  \n\nThis place is an old horse track through and through.  Fun way to waste an afternoon and decent amount of money on sucker bets.  Beer is not overly expensive and if you catch it on $1 hotdog night - you can add gluttony to your list of sins for the day.\n\nThat said, this place is an old horse track through and through.  Desperate need of a face lift when it comes to the grandstand / restrooms.  \n\nLastly, I really wish this place was 18+ or at least had rules about children being left unattended.  As it has neither (or least doesn't enforce either) this is a playground for FANTASTIC parents who let their children go Lord of Fly's while they gamble away their afternoon.  But alas, drink enough - and they're just blurs in the background with makeshift spears.",0,1
"Fool me thrice, well, that's my fault but I've finally learned my lesson. \n\nIssue #1: I take a suit in to be dry cleaned because it smelled a little like a smoky bar and had some fur on it. I have a week's leeway before I need it. I go to get it when I'm told it will be ready and I'm told there's a delay because of excessive \""""stainage\"""". Well, since there weren't any stains, I ask for a manager. At this point, the woman behind the counter says she needs to call me back. When she does call back, they admit to not knowing where it is. Eek! Ultimately they find it at whatever place they outsource it to and I was able to get it back later that day. Not a disaster, but should hav ebeen a red flag.\n\nIssue #2: a pair of jeans that I have hemmed end up 4\"""" too short. Well, I was pissed, but I didn't try them on for the tailor to measure and he just measured based on what I was wearing right then because I was in a hurry. I guess I thought that maybe it was possible that they could stretch in a different way or, I don't know, something. I took the blame for it and didn't make an issue.\n\nThe final issue: I paid for a pair of expensive pants to be hemmed and put a rush on them so they would be done by Thursday. I called on Thursday and they told me they'd be done on Saturday. Annoying, but nothing I could do. So, on Saturday I go in and the woman working says they can't find them... AGAIN. I wait for about 30 minutes while she makes a series of calls, to no avail, and then tells me she'll call me when they find them. Towards the end of the day they find them and I go to pick them up. They actually had the nerve to charge me. You'd think if you'd screwed a customer over this way, you might give them a freebie to make up for it. Not this place.

We were also asked if we wanted bread and butter prior to dinner-- to which we said yes-- was also never served.\n\nSadly lacking for a $200 bill.  Wouldn't go back.

"This review is strictly for the pharmacy.\n\nIF YOU HAVE A CHOICE, GO ELSEWHERE! I've been here a few times and I always left a little irritated. This is the closest 24 hour pharmacy by me but I try to avoid it if I can. I usually wait until the next day to go to my usual CVS. Unfortunately, my mom needed her prescriptions right away.\n\nI drop off the prescriptions for my mom. The guy said it would take about 30-35 minutes. Okay cool! Since my mom had to take food with her medication, we decided to stay close by and order some food to go. We got back to CVS after about 45 minutes. It turns out that they haven't even started the prescription. They were extremely backed up and it would take 2 hours!! UMMM WHAT?! NO. I was quoted 30-35 minutes and the guy who was helping me earlier was no longer there. Then they told me it would be ready for me in 1 hour. Apparently, they couldn't do anything better than that. I don't understand why they couldn't fill it right then and there. \nIf they had originally quoted me 2 hours, I wouldn't have made it a big deal. It's understandable that they are backed up and I would've gone home and went back. \n\nOh the nightmare doesn't end there. When I go back to the pharmacy, it turns out that the insurance they had on file was expired. So the lady is trying to update it and whatnot. My mom's insurance company's system was down for a routine update. Now I can't pick up the prescriptions until the morning!! I understand that they have no control of that but WHY didn't someone check the insurance when I dropped off the prescription and when I tried to pick it up the first time?? UGHH..\nAT LEAST the lady was nice enough to give my mom one pill from each bottle to tie her over until the morning!\n\nTL;DR\nI went to the pharmacy a total of FOUR times in a span of 12 hours just to get a prescription for my mom.

"Came in after some highly touted recommendations. \nStood at the front for approx. 4-5 mins before anyone acknowledged us (other than the pianist who was  a little too loud).\n\nWe were seated then another 10 mins passed at which point I waved down a waiter so we didn't need to continue our wait. \n\nWe promptly ordered, 2 salads, 3 entrees.\nSalads came out in about 10-15 mins.\n\nI started with a spinach salad (w/pecans, cranberries& feta). It was very good, even though they were out of the requested raspberry  vinaigrette  dressing...balsamic vinaigrette was used instead.

This deli was phenomenal.  We ate here late at night (they are open 24 hours) and opted for #1 which was a pastrami and corned beef sandwich.  The food came out quick and it was excellent.  I would highly recommend this place for a late night deli sandwich.,1,1
"Stayed here this past weekend and was not impressed at all. The Studio was very small and I needed to upgrade to a 1 bedroom.

I went downstairs and verified with the front desk that a Host could sign off on the upgrade. \nAll through the weekend I gambled at Planet Hollywood, and when I checked out, I was told that there was no affiliation with the actual casino. This was a total bait & switch from what I was told. At checkout, the clerk told me she would hold the upgraded room charge on the side until a manager called me, since I was leaving town. NO phone call and they put the charge through after I left.\nI called the day I saw it on my credit card statement (2 days after) and finally spoke to manager. He provided no understanding or sympathy towards the situation. He only stated that his staff is trained not to say that...well, someone told me that they'd cover it...TWICE!\nIn any case, there are much  nicer hotels to stay at in Vegas that have better amenities.

They were rude & blamed mistake on ME and would not refund any money. They left the pizzas at my home & I got home 8 minutes later to a pizza on the doorstep with a confused delivery girl, asking me to pay (even though it was already paid for).

On another pizza the pepperoni created so much grease it looked un-appetizing. \n\n3. Pizza tasted like death. Crust was gross, toppings were burnt, blah. Have you ever eaten a cold naked pizza? Don't. \n\n4. After feeling gross from eating blah tasting pizza & thoroughly pissed off for having a ruined Friday night (should also mention we had friends over for a diamondbacks game- and EVERYONE was disgusted & now HATES naked with a passion) we called Naked. Woman, young manager was extremely rude. After a long (5 minute) phone fight she finally refunded our money. \n\n5. Great marketing idea, but just disgusting. \n\n6. Honestly: dominoes (gross) or pizza hut (sick) or even frozen pizza taste ten times better.",0,0
"Huge selection of Quebec beer, good prices, knowledgable staff. Always a great place to wander the aisles and pick up a few interesting beers. They also sell glasses, shirts, and hot sauce made with beer for the beer fanatic in your life.  \n\nJust a word of warning though - if you're looking for American craft beer, or even craft beer from the rest of Canada, you won't be able to find it here.

"Stopped in for a latte and a breakfast sandwich.  Jaw nearly hit the floor when told total was over $12.50 so I expected a good sandwich for that price!  Nope, got a pre-made microwaved sandwich that was no bigger than a slider.  Small hot latte was $4.25.  Skip this place!",0,1

"This is our favorite Teppanyaki place, never has sushi at this location.  Expect to pay $25 for a typical entree.  We usually skip drinks to save $$$.\n\nThe atmosphere is nice, good separation between the bar/sushi area and the cooking tables.  I never expect anything but average service from a Japanese Restaurant and this is no exception.  \n\nMost recently I had Scallops/Shrimp combo and it was delightful.  Scallops prepared excellent, not rubbery, can't say the same thing about the shrimp.  Daughter had chicken which always tastes a bit funny to me and son had NY Steak and wife opted for the Filet.  As a family we all love their fried rice as part of the entree' it's what keeps us coming back.  Miso soup was average and the salad was quite good.\n\nAs they say, we all left fat dumb and happy with some leftovers for lunch the next day.\n\nFamily of four with tip, $115.",1,1

There is a lot of random knick knacks and ribbon and feminine gifty things populating the center of the restaurant. I thought it was very odd and distracting but my wife said it made the place feel homey. \n\nThe service has been less than stellar during our three visits and the ladies taking our order are always grumpy and don't look like they want to be there, or helping us. \n\nThe deserts didn't blow me away either.

"This is one of my favorite places in Pittsburgh.  I would give it 5 stars but I have 2 issues.  The hot dog and the bun.  They finish the dogs on a flat top so they can get a little greasy.  Also the bun just kinda sucks. It falls apart pretty easily. Personally they could do better with a different bun vendor.\n\nAs for the toppings, they are fantastic. I always do the Bahn Mi and lately have been adding the devil dog.

"Where should I start with this review. I run a local restaurant and tried to order flowers for our place. I spent 38 minutes on the phone placing the order with their service, at the end of the call the operator tells me if there's an issue with the large order they will call me. I arrive to the shop a couple hours later to make sure they could accommodate my order. HERE'S THE CRAZY PART!! This f;@$ing lady tells me to get out of her store!! Yelling at me saying I'm committing fraud and she is calling the cops, WHAT!! The order was for almost $500. This was the rudest most unprofessional lady I had ever met. Being that I'm in the hospitality business I have know idea how this place is in business. Not only will I never do business here, I will make sure that anyone I come in contact with knows what a crazy bitch this Bonnie lady is. If I can help just one person avoid this shop I did my part, but I have a feeling Bonnie will do a better job of scaring away people than I ever could.",0,0
This place is awesome.  Looks like a true hole-in-the-wall from the outside. Very unassuming.  But inside is actually quite nice with colorful chandeliers and a nice bar area - bathrooms were nice too-  \n\nThe food is phenomenal.  And cheap!!!  Go on Tuesdays - special is the carne adovada.  And the carne adovada is to die for.  Two people can easily split one order and be totally full.  You can cut the meat with a spoon.  Mmmmm so yummy just thinking about it.  I want to try other food choices but I just know I won't be able to tear myself away from re-ordering the adovada.  \n\nEveryday of the week a different menu choice is on special so make a week out of Blue Adobe :),1,1

It took them 5 minutes to seat us, then another 5 minutes to wait on us by the time we ordered our food we missed happy hour.  We asked the waitress if we could still order off the happy hour menu and she said no.  It took her forever to bring our drinks finally out and then when our appetizer came out we asked about the cornbread, she said she would go get that.Then when we were finished we didn't get our bill in a timely manner either.

Come to find out, they changed the install date, never BOTHERED to tell me, and then canceled my service when I called and started raising a fuss. THEN, the supervisor refuses to apologize for the girl deciding to cancel my service and tells me it's no hassle to keep it cancelled.  I've been on the phone over two hours with them today, and their final response was \""""Well, if you still want our service, you're going to have to wait a few weeks.\""""  Several reviewers had the same experience of if you raise a fuss, they just cancel your contract.

"While Dr. Finley is a good doctor with an excellent and caring demeanor, the office policies and staff are another story.  The first thing that set me off was Dr. Rachel Gittler. After examining me, she actually prescribed a medication that was not effective for someone like me. Needless to say, I was hot under the collar because of her startling and possibly life-threatening incompetence.  \n\nFast forward to a few months ago.  My wife needed an emergency refill on her medications. Long story short,  it took more than a week and six trips to CVS to finally get them because every time they told us the prescriptions were ordered, the pharmacy had no knowledge of the order. Add the unnecessary inconvenience of having to go back to the office for an appointment whenever meds are needed and you have an idea of the vicious circle my wife was in.  Additionally,  Erica was extremely rude to my wife and even provoked a verbal altercation.  \n\nAs a witness to all of this and a former patient, I cannot ever recommend the practice.  But if Dr. Finley is at a different office, definitely get her.",0,0

"We went here last night to get a late night snack. \n\nI ordered the shrimp balls. I didn't care for them. They were like a shrimp sausage meatball. I was hoping for more like whole shrimp. They were probably made the traditional way, so they may be good to people who are expecting that. But I didn't care for the texture nor the flavor. The dipping sauce was pretty good though.\n\nMy wife ordered the red bean shaved ice. It was okay. The flavor was decent and reminded me of red beans and rice. I'm not a fan of tapioca pearls though. I don't like the consistency. Again, it was probably made traditionally and may be enjoyable if that's what you liker expecting. But it's just not my thing. I'm kind of weird about consistency.\n\nWhile I'm not giving a great rating, it's based more on my personal preferences. I wouldn't dissuade people from going there if they like boba drinks.

Ive been to MANY thrift stores here and in Colorado and this one may be cheap but the quality is janky!  Its not organized at all and annoying.

"First, the good part: waiter and manager were very receptive and friendly and tried their best to help. Also, decor and space is fine-- clean and open, what you expect from an upscale chain. \n\nThe bad part: the salads we ordered looked like a pre-made salad that you can buy in a bag at the supermarket. The first time it came out there were wilted pieces and they forgot to add the chicken. They were very apologetic and brought out new salads. This time they came out without wilted leaves, but still the produce was as dry and brittle as the first time. The chicken was also overcooked, dry. Maybe I wouldn't mind so much if it wasn't a $13 salad. I didn't expect anything fancy, but I do want carefully prepared and fresh food. \n\nWe then wondered if maybe it wasn't the fault of the restaurant, but of their food suppliers--the cost of being a chain restaurant. But then we went across to the street to the Wynn and had a delicious, vibrant, salad. \n\nSo though I appreciate Maggiano's eager and friendly service and pleasant decor, I think they would do better to focus on the quality of their food.",0,1

"This was THE worst mani/pedi experience of my life. I arrived on time for my appointment and was not greeted until after ten minutes of sitting in the reception area. And then was told by the owner I couldn't have the 5 minute massage I requested because there wasn't enough time. Really?! Someone could have been massaging my feet in the time it took you to greet me? And also, I was unaware when I made my appointment I had to request extra time for a five minute foot rub?!? Not normal. The staff was totally unprofessional. My manicurist and the manicurist she was stationed next to used foul language and spoke negatively about the owner which made me feel incredibly uncomfortable. They didn't even soak my hands to soften my cuticle. Went straight into pushing them back and cutting them making them bleed. They didn't even clean under my nails. The pedicure didnt draw any blood but was as equally awful, not relaxing, and uncomfortable. The worst part about it all is I paid over $60 for this torture. Basically I paid that ridiculous amount to have my nails painted. Something I could have just don't myself. Never. Again.",0,0

My only complaint is inconsistencies with the cleaning staff.  They did not change my towels.  I am fine with using the same towels for a few days, but what really bothered me was the fact that they didn't change the washcloths.  I finally left a note with a tip requesting clean washcloths, and I received one.  I didn't receive any more clean washcloths until I again left a note with a tip.  Also, they didn't leave new water in the fridge or tea packets daily, just from time to time.  I did, however get a little bonus of lip balm and a face spray one day next to my soap.",1,1

Bentos are served just like how you would get them in Hawaii & a pretty packed plate for the price. There's always poke bowls on the specials list, but when Poke Express is open that's where I usually order from. Spicy Ahi (tuna with masago & mayo) is the BEST! & if you're into octopus.. Tako with limu is my recommendation!\n\nI probably should've written a review a long time ago, but I guess I was just too busy inhaling all my food. :D",1,1

"A Yogurtland is a Yogurtland. They are all pretty much the same to me: good quality yogurt, decent selection of flavors, lots of yummy toppings, and fair per ounce pricing.  Since I like Yogurtland, I was excited when this location opened up in Henderson. \n\nJust like the Town Square location, by biggest gripe with this Yogurtland is that they do not cut their fruit toppings smaller. And that is admittedly a very minor gripe. \nThis location also gets rather busy in the evenings...  Currently on Monday evenings  buy-1-get-1-free promotion that runs from 4-7 pm, you can pretty much count on a long line on Mondays. \n\nThe good far outweighs the bad at Yogurtland in my opinion. There is always a large selection of flavors, including sugar free options. The yogurt and toppings have nutritional info like the calories count per ounce, helpful for us ladies watching our waistlines. The staff is usually quite friendly and helpful. The toppings are fresh, there is a good variety of fruit toppings as well candy, and my personal favorite popping boba! \n\nBe sure to download the Yogurtland app, not only do you not have to dig through your wallet for a rewards card, but you also get 3 free ounces if you do!",1,1
"No, no, no, no. That's all I can say if you are planning on eating here.  \n\nMy daughter and I went in today, on a Sunday afternoon, because we couldn't find another Mexican restaurant that was open on Sunday in central Phoenix. The service was fine but the food was awful. The beans tasted like they came from a can (Rosarita brand) and the salsa was just barely palatable for the same reason. We each ate only half of our food before  leaving.  \n\nWhen the waiter asked how the food was, I told him and all he did was say he was sorry. No offer to bring something else or comp one of our half-eaten meals. \n\nMacayo's on Central used to have fresh food, now it is just stale and tastes like it comes from a can. You can definitely tell that they are cutting corners in the kitchen. For the prices they charge, You have a right to expect better food. \n\nI will never go there again.",0,0
"My fiancee and I have been putting off going back to see the University of Illinois campus for a while now. We saw that Super 8 was having a crazy anniversary sale on rooms where if you booked online on a certain date and time, your room would only be $8.88. We decided this would be the perfect oppurtunity to head down to Champaign so we tried to book the room and got it.\n\nThis is the point where I tell you if I had paid any more than $8.88, I would have felt ripped off. The room smelled very weird (that smell that makes you think someone could have died in there but they used enough chemicals to kill every last skin cell), the bedding was very itchy, and the shower curtain didn't even have any plastic liner to keep the water in the tub. The only positives (the reason it gets two stars instead of one) were that there was good pressure in the shower and the location was not bad. Honestly though, unless it is a crazy deal like we had, there are better hotels in the area. There is even a nicer Super 8 near Lincoln Avenue.",0,1

For you non-Americans, that means it's spicy, not spicy like that ketchup and onions you try to pass off as salsa over there, but real spice that will make your tongue crawl back to your stomach.

The duck was seasoned well and crispy from pan frying.  The curry was very good, and medium was a good level of pepper.

"Worst place ever! Worst service! Worst experience! These people are not used to serving food. Got this Groupon for my dads birthday and ended up having to take him to Hoffbrahaus to make it up to him afterwards. First off, there are no belly dancers even though they advertise it. We were a group of 4. Called beforehand to see if reservations were needed and was told they don't take them. When we got there we were the only people \""""dining\"""" and they were scrambling and apologizing for being shorthanded. Again, we were the only ones in the entire place eating and it was like 7pm.

I have been to authentic middle eastern restaurants where you sit on the floor and am part Bengali so I know what to expect. The floor plan was ridiculous for \""""dining\"""". We had to share this tiny little coffee table with 4 orders of food. Two people had to sit on chairs while the other two on the floor, which made for a very awkward seating arrangement.

I was lucky bc I ordered a pepsi which came instantly in a can. One ordered a specialty iced tea, which should already be pre made/ready to serve since it's cold. My poor dad had to steal some of my drink. But wait, it gets better! Food came out at different times for everyone and was mediocre at best. My falafel sandwich was mushy and bland. Pita was dry. Fries that were supposed to come with the meal, came after everyone finished their meal. Fries were good and plentiful, but too little too late. No napkins were provided until I had to go up to ask for them-ALSO after everyone finished their meal. They said they ran out of napkins and handed me a dirty roll of paper towels from the kitchen instead. No joke. We were expecting Arabic music and instead we got blaring explicit uncensored offensive rap which they did not change after I politely asked them to.

"The Regent Square Theater...a great place to go for film lovers.  \n\nI have all but stopped going to 'the movies' because of the general societal behavior at the cineplexes.  I am a film geek all the way, and when I go to see something on a big screen I am seriously going to see a 'film' that is art presented as it is intended to be seen...large.  I do not go to a cinema for the social aspect, or to kill time with a date, or to just get out for an evening, with what's showing on the screen being secondary to the purpose of the evening.  \n\nWhen I go to see a film, I do NOT go to listen to the conversations of others, the bleeping of the cell phones, the clicking of mindless text messaging or silly giggling that comes from someone's interaction that has nothing to do with what's on the screen.\n\nThis is where the Regent Square Theater wins.  This is a cinema for serious film lovers. You may not find a HUGE audience, but what you will find is an audience of people who know how to behave in a cinema, who are there for the same purpose...to see a good film on a big screen.  The audience at the Regent Square theater know directors, and they might actually be able to hold a conversation about the director, his or her films, other similar films and directors, and they know to wait to do it when the film has ended.  \n\nThe Regent Square is a very comfortable old-style small theater.  One screen. Small reasonably friendly staff, affordable prices (although the last night I went the popcorn, which was cheap, was also a tad stale) and most importantly...a venue for excellent films.  Foreign, indie, documentary...and some classics thrown in regularly to enable us to see some of those old gems on a big screen, where most of them were meant to be.  I never realized how important that big screen was until I'd seen The Wizard Of Oz, after years of mini-televised viewings with chopped and hacked commercial interruptions, on a big screen at a special showing somewhere else. One who doesn't watch these things on a big screen doesn't know what they're missing by not seeing the full large scope of the intended art.  \n\nSome (in this era, I can't claim 'many') directors truly do use the big screen when creating their art. Jeunet, Almodovar, and a few others still do present film as art, and the Regent Square (and Pittsburgh Filmmakers who operates it) bring these gems to that big screen.\n\nAnd to a film aficionado, the right atmosphere is crucial when getting lost in this art. The Regent Square Theater knows this, and so do its audiences.\n\nThank you for providing an intellectual oasis in da burgh...and a great evening of cinema enjoyment.",1,1

I only had one meal which was very lemony and very salty and ... it was during happy hour, and the waitress brought new and also didn't charge me.  \nGET THE ROASTED VEGETABLES.  AMAZING.  I beg for the dressing recipe everytime I go.

"Went to Vegas for my birthday weekend planning to have a nice trip with family and friends. Everything was great up until this buffet. We went on Saturday for some breakfast which was okay. That experience gets four stars for great service and decent tasting breakfast foods. Today, Sunday, was an ebtirely different story. Wanted to top the weekend off with an awesome Luau themed buffet recommended by the awesome staff from yesterday only to be majorly disappointed. Excited, we waited in a two and a half hour line which was totally no big based on Saturday's great service and the awesome Hawaiian dishes we were about to experience. Then we get to the cashier who cashes out the first half of our party of five but snubs the second half without a basic \""""one moment please\"""" just turns around and processes someone else through (she knew we were a part of the same party, no excuses for a bad attitude and crap customer service). Hostess who sat us was wonderful all smiles. The second host who sat us was less than accompdating. As she was setting silverware I attempted to ask her about the champagne service for brunch because we were craving a couple of mimosas and knew the service would end soon. She blatantly ignored me to scurry off somewhere else. My friend caught her again after a few minutes and she merely told us the sever we had been waiting for to take our drinks would be right with us before scurrying away without waiting for a response. Which she probably knew would have been that our waiter hadn't come by our table in the twenty minutes we had been sitting there. Finally we catch a hold of a random guy serving a nearby table, Steve, and he's great totally takes our orders and even though its his first day he's doing a splendid job. Unfortunately, we are unable to get our mimosas because they stopped serving the champagne after 3:30. Twenty minutes after we were sat and ten minutes after we finally found a waiter to take our drink order. Normally, the sucky service would have just been shrugged off. But being told we didn't make it for the champagne when we did and had waited in a two and a half hour line partly for that service. Was going to leave only one star but Steve's awesomeness gets its own star. Conclusion: pretty good food but sh*t customer service on Sunday brunch days. Don't wait in line expecting the food to make up for bad customer service. Not worth the $20 to get in or the $13 with the players card. Would not come back here and will definitely not recommend it.",0,0

"Okay, a friend came back to the burgh for a long weekend and after much pleading, begging, and finally, paying me off to take her to this popular Pittsburgh heart clogging, frat boy hangout. If you've had one, you've had every sandwich they sell. They all taste the same, maybe if they salted the fries? Anyway I guess I outgrew the taste of these grease balls. A cold Sam Adams was sitting in front of me and suddenly I thought of it, I can eat healthy by getting turkey, no cheese, fries, or mayo. The waiter looked perplexed after asking him if I could just have turkey with onion, slaw, and tomato. Didn't matter, my sandwich came with fries anyway, guess you can't teach an old dog new tricks. I picked the fries off and gave them to my friend, who by the way does not take Zocor.

"Unfortunately, my experience was much similar to Mark's. The staff was indeed friendly, but entirely unequipped to provide proper attention to a patient's individual needs. My therapist, Melissa, was nice, but after the initial assessment she failed to explain in any detail the source of my pain, where it might have come from or illustrate a course of action. Instead, I was handed a sheet of exercises that looked like I could have printed it off of Google.\n\nMelissa often had more than one patient scheduled during our appointments. I would arrive, and she would have me work on a machine while she saw to someone else. On multiple occasions I would spend entire minutes sitting, motionless, waiting for Melissa to come back and instruct me. This is \""""treatment\"""" - time that I was billed for! This did not seem to be the case with Melissa alone, either. At almost all times there were at least six patients for a total of two or three therapists. One morning a woman even brought her labrador into the treatment room and it proceeded to bound around, off-leash, for her entire session. I'm a dog lover as much as the next person, but it's bad enough I have to share precious time with other members of the same species, much less a dog!\n\nUltimately, I received no relief, no specialized attention and no care. I stopped treatment after three visits and would not recommend this clinic. In addition, as Mark said, be sure to read the \""""Welcome\"""" form - it will inform you what your insurance deductible is and how much has been met. Under my plan, previous chiropractic and physical therapy treatments had not been subject to a deductible, but my benefits had recently changed. I was shocked to get a bill in the mail for $570! That is an outrageous amount to pay for such poor care: patients need to be informed of what mediocre medical treatment will cost them. \n\nI will add that, after expressing my dissatisfaction to the Patient Services manager, she was quick to respond and offer a resolution that I thought was fair. As stated before, the entire staff is courteous and patient, but I would caution that it may be worth your time to seek treatment elsewhere.",0,1

This place charges $47 for what should be $13.98...When I asked the staff if these prices were for real, she immediately tells me she will honor a matching price. Guess she is used to hearing this. I should have walked out but it was late and I didnt feel like going into another store. Then it took the staff person almost 15 min to figure out how to ring me up at the lower price.

The reasoning was that there were so many underagers staying at the hotel, but my friends and I were not impressed. Additionally, this policy was not announced on the website.

"I was in town this past weekend with my son and four of his groomsman for his bachelor party.  We needed a steak and found this place here on Yelp.  After the mostly very positive reviews, we decided to go.  \n\nCircus Circus.  What can I say.  Wayyyy past its prime.  But nicely hidden, so much so that if you're not really looking you will miss it, is The Steakhouse.  What a nice surprise.  \n\nThis is a throwback to the old school style steakhouse which my son and I totally love.  Dark wood, cozy surroundings etc.  I was looking for the Rat Pack. (Frank, Dino, Sammy)  You walk right past the grill area when you are seated and we had a table where we could watch the guys cooking the steaks.  Kind of neat.   Just a great atmosphere for eating a steak dinner with friends.\n\nWe were greeted by our waiter, Ray, promptly.  I mentioned the bachelor party thing and he immediately lit up and was engaged in making our time a good one.  He is a veteran of the game and knew just how to take care of us.  Drinks and food were ordered and away we went.\n\nWhere they stumbled was with the food.  Drinks were great, salads were very good.  But 3 of us had ordered steak medium rare and received medium well.  Also, I ordered a lobster tail with my ribeye and the tail was raw on the inside.  BUT our man Ray handled the situation professionally which is to say with no comment other than a sincere apology and the offer to redo the meals which we accepted.  Unfortunately, a few minute later, a runner came out with my lobster tail which had clearly been nuked in the microwave.  All shriveled up and steaming.  Ray was nearby and I flagged him down and he was aghast.  The ruined tail was taken away no questions asked.  We a were offered a round of free cocktails while we waited and it was a bachelor party so....Way to go Ray.\n\nUnfortunately our 3 friends were done with their meals when our redone meals arrived.  But they arrived completely fresh and perfectly done.   No recycled veggies etc.  In the end we all had terrific meals and were completely satisfied.\n\nBut again, the fantastic Ray then offers unsolicited our choice of free dessert or an after dinner drink of our choice.  Again, being it was a bachelor party....We all had generous shots of a nice high end bourbon for \""""dessert.\""""\n\nSo even though there were a few hiccups, the staff handled them very well and we were completely satisfied.

"For reference i went to this place Wednesday june 30th at 11pm. Where should i start with this place? First, extremely pricey and 1 drink per person minimum. Three drinks and one hookah is $42.00. second, right away service wad horrible, drinks took 20 minutes to reach our table and that is after checking on them twice just to find out the kid who was making the drinks just left them in the blender and walked upstairs to chat up two girls that I guess he was more interested in than helping paying customers. ( mind you this was at 11pm on Wednesday with only one other couple there at the time so it's not like the  kid was busy).  So that being said the hookah actually took even LONGER than the drinks about 35 mins to be exact. And after delivering the hookah it became very harsh within 4 mins of sampling it. When we went to go ask the kid at the front to fix it we found him smoking what seemed to be (and smelled like marijuana) upstairs with his little gfs. We at this point were so upset that he was not helping us at all that we demanded a refund in which he said he couldn't even give us even though we did not even touch the hookah. The kids name is Blake. Or at least that's the name he gave us lol. But I would never recommend this place and would honestly love to give it negative stars If possible. Good luck getting any kind of service here. And if you get a kid named Blake on Wednesday night good luck getting anything you ordered.",0,0

"If you like high quality sushi this place is for you. Don't get me wrong, it is pricey. But if you're in Las Vegas it's worth it to enjoy a nice dinner. The ambiance is beautiful with the chandeliers, tables, and chairs. The windows on one side overlook the pool. Everything we had was amazing. We had a few sushi items as appetizers including the albacore sashimi with crispy onions and soup. My entr\u00e9e was the sea bass, which was cooked to perfection. The desserts were unbelievable, we had a combination of three different ice creams and fruit with shaved ice, which was prepared at the table. The staff were very courteous and respectful. I definitely recommend Andrea's if you enjoy fine dining.",1,1

"I took a huge leap of faith and decided to try Salon42 in Dilworth. My husband and I moved to North Carolina about a month ago so we're still fairly new and I've been dying for a haircut. After MUCH research, I went with my gut feeling that Salon42 was going to be a great decision...and I must say, I LOVED IT! The salon looks awesome and I love how the layout is. My stylist, Sabrina, did my hair and I am so in love with it! She was such a doll and knew exactly what I wanted with \""""I think I need layers and thinning\"""" lol! She is very talented and just knows what hairstyle will fit you. Will be coming back, and will make my husband swing by too!\n\nI recommend Salon42, and most definitely Sabrina!",1,1

"Who doesn't enjoy a lazy Sunday morning? I love spending time leisurely reading the Sunday news while getting caught up on a weeks worth of cooking shows. After a few hours hunger finally sets in and its time to find something cheap and easy. While that might sound more like a lifestyle choice than a way of eating, cheap and easy to me means dim sum, and lots of it. With a fistful of cash and my growing appetite I head over to my default dim sum house, Golden Buddha. \n\nLocated in the Chinese Cultural Center, Golden Buddha has been pushing carts every weekend for the past few years. Over those years they've become a destination for steamy delights and have built quite a following with groups usually packing the lobby. Here's some advice, for a lesser selection with no waiting, go early. If you want more selection and don't mind the wait, go after noon. \n\nRanging in price from $2.35-$6.50, Golden Buddha pretty much offers mainstream selections from dumplings and chicken feet to rice and noodles. Most of the cart pushers don't speak much English but know this; most items are either made with pork or shrimp. \n\nWithin minutes of being sat the first smiling server rolls up her cart and begins pimping her wares. As she lifts the steel lid from the first steam basket, the mist dissipates to reveal 3 white fluffy hidden treasures beneath. Know as char siu bao, or steamed BBQ pork buns, these are pretty standard for any dim sum brunch. Pulling apart one of the doughy pillows reveals its sweet porky center, add some chile oil for added depth. Probably the most typical offering is the pork dumplings or sui mai, a wonton wrapper filled with ground pork and black mushrooms. These meaty bites have an enjoyable earthiness that left me wanting to ask for another basket.\n\nThe next cart to come along is absolutely filled with fried items. I love the crispy crunch of egg rolls and while the GB version was crisp, the inside was filled with oil that tasted like last nights fish. After only a single bite the rest remained untouched. Seemingly fried in the same oil, the salt and pepper shrimp were not only super fishy but the shells were also left on. Shell on shrimp isn't usually a problem when the shrimp in question is cooked really well. Not the case with these, they were ruined before they even hit the table, greasy and salty.\n\nOn a lighter note, wrapped in translucent rice paper, the spring rolls were large, filled with chewy rice noodles and 3 plump shrimp, unfortunately these were also flavorless. \n\nA new one for me was the Zhaliang, a long tubular Chinese doughnut that is tightly cocooned in a sheet of rice noodle. The end result is more about texture than bold flavor; I can see how so many people seek these out for breakfast being chewy and crispy at the same time. \n\nDim sum brunch isn't complete without at least one Chinese dessert. Pointing at a plate of pineapple buns or bo lo yau from the dessert cart, these pastries actually contain no pineapple. Instead the name refers to its crunchy checkered top crust. Inside the bun you'll get a sweet surprise of satisfyingly sweet custard filling.\n\nWhile I left satisfied, overall Golden Buddha doesn't quite have the chops they used to, but in a pinch or on a lazy Sunday morning, they'll do just fine.",0,1
"One of the few places in Vegas I can go to and enjoy Tex-Mex. Having grown up in Fort Worth, I prefer Tex-Mex to Cali-Mex, and OTB has a great menu that reminds me of home. I especially enjoy their empanadas, their salsa, and the flautas, but just about everything on the menu is great.",1,1
"This was next to my ex's old apartment.  We always got coffee there in the mornings, whoever was up first would hop over and get some coffee.  Usually it was her.  The coffee was ok, looking back it wasn't worth a trip to the place next door.\n\nThe food?  Don't get me started.  It's the most inadequate food I've ever had to pay for.  The bread was stale, the meats were boring, the vegetables were weak.  Because it was next door, we'd eat their from time to time.  And it honestly wasn't that great.\n\nDon't go out of your way to eat here, but if you happen to live next door, it's an ok stop for coffee.\n\nAlthough, I must admit: it was nice to kick back in the outdoor dining area and relax with a coffee.",0,0

"Ordered some takeout from this place...it wasn't bad...but it wasn't very noteworthy either.  A-OK is the right feeling behind the review.\n\nTried their Gyro sandwich and Gyro fries since my Sister was boasting about it.\n\nThe gyro meat here has an interesting taste...more like a skillet char vs the rotisserie style, but my sister said they do have the spit here.  It also seemed a bit on the salty side but overall enjoyable to eat.\n\nThe fries were pretty plain-jane boring though.  For gyro fries, they only added meat.  None of the cucumber/Tzatziki sauce, no veggies, nothing but plain meat on the fries.  And since I had the complaint above about it being a bit on the salty end, it was a little bit of a bummer.\n\nAt least the prices are very cheap though...nobody's gonna break the bank giving it a go.\n\nI should come back and try their Philly Steak...after all, that is what they named their place after...presume that's what their specialty is!  I only ordered the Gyro since it was raved about :/",0,1

My install was scheduled for between 9-11 am on a Saturday, dude called at 2:30 to say he was the \""""outside guy\"""" and was on his way. Was indignant when I asked about the earlier time frame (actually I laughed when I answered the phone and found out who he was....3.5 hrs late!), but I let him come and do at least the outside work. Called the number on my scheduled appt email at 3:30, got a woman who knew nothing about my issues, tried to transfer me to dispatch, transfer failed. She called me back, I asked for a supervisor and was on hold for 15 minutes. She called back again, tried to transfer me to somebody else, said there was a \""""problem\"""" with my order, but she couldn't tell me what it was. After another 20 minutes on hold, I hung up. She called back once more, told me she would call me as soon as the department was available - never heard back. Unbelievable!

"Let me start by saying I used to live in Vegas and Pure used to be my favorite club. It's beautiful, great location and a fabulous view of the strip. If it was industry night I was there. Saturday night I was there. Loved it.\n\nMaybe I'm just older and wiser now, maybe Pure Management did it better than AMG, maybe I've been in Oregon way too long, I don't really know, but I was done after 10 minutes there during our vacation this June. \n\nThe door staff is simply rude. Like straight up ignore you rude. Not a good way to kick off the night. From there we made it to the patio and got our drinks, the bar staff was great....but they should be since they want tips. The club was full of just turning 21ers screaming woohoo the entire time, girls in flip flops and leggings (upscale?) and some older couples getting jiggy on the dance floor. We thought about making a drinking game out of the woohoos but we would have been really drunk, really fast and spent a lot of money on shots' The dj was horrible, even if I had been drunk there was no flow to dance to. \n\nWe were there maybe 45 min and I'd had enough.

"This is a nice little Latin American themed restaurant. It has a very homey feel, like you're visiting someone's home kitchen. The staff members were friendly and working hard. We tried the chilaquiles, tortilla soup, and shredded beef tacos. The chilaquiles were very good, especially the tender pieces of flavorful chicken and the fresh green chili sauce. The tortilla soup was hearty and had a pleasant flavor. The tortilla strips and melted queso fresco inside added a nice touch. The shredded beef was marinated in interesting flavors (something beer/alcohol-based I believe) and made for a good light taco meal. The prices were fair, with entrees coming in around $10 and individual tacos at $2 each. The soup was very good, but at $6, it feels a little overpriced. Overall, it was a good experience and a tasty meal. They even gave me a tea refill to go afterwards. I would like to visit again.\n\nI am concerned about the service, however. While the two people there were friendly and working hard, it was a tad bit slow with only a few tables occupied. Since it appears that the only staff is a mother/daughter team, there is no way they could adequately serve this place if it were half or more filled. There were tables filled with leftovers from previous guests as we left, which is another sign that it's just too much work to keep up with when understaffed. Thus, the experience of a diner during a busier time would likely be worse than my own on this trip.",1,1

For our entrees, I ordered the baked lasagna and my boyfriend ordered the double bacon cheeseburger.

"I really, really, really, like their food.  The spring rolls and Pad Thai are amazing.  I used to get delivery to my house regularly because they are only 1 mile away and delivery was free.\n\nNow though disappointingly, they are not offering delivery though they still have a big sign on their front window that says \""""We deliver\"""" which I think they should remove.  I called on New Year's Eve wanting delivery and when they said they did not have delivery @ the moment I asked if it was because it was New Year's Eve.

"Very disappointed with my experience yesterday!  Being a new restaurant I expected first week bugs.  Customer service is very important to me and today Haymaker missed the mark.  \n\nUpon arriving we were greeted and seated quickly.  We were hoping to order breakfast but was told it was no longer an option because they stopped taking orders for breakfast at 11:30 (though it was 11:25 at the time).  Not a problem, their lunch menu looked great.  We waited for 20 minutes for about first contact with one if the wait staff.  We asked for recommendations when we were greeted by the waitress and, with her recommendation, ordered our food and drinks at the same time.   We then proceeded to wait for over an hour food.  About 50 minutes in, we were told that they were sorry for the wait they were having difficulty in the kitchen transitioning from breakfast to lunch.  We politely thank her and recognized that we understood.  About 65 minutes into our wait, our food arrived.  We ordered a French Dip sandwich and their BLAT (bacon, lettuce, avocado & fried tomato).  The French Dip was great, a little soggy but had a great taste.  The BLAT was very dry and lacked taste.  It was not bad enough to not eat but was not very good.  \n\nAt the end of the meal we asked if there was anything they could do for us for the wait.  The waitress stated that she had already asked the manager and she had said no.  We then asked to talk to the manager and she said that she was sorry and she recognized that we had waited a very long time for our meal.  She stated that they were new and it was the computer/transition to breakfast and there was nothing they could do.  After a few more minutes of conversation, she agreed to comp us one meal.  \n\nI first recommend the manager reading the book Fred 2.0.  The customer experience is so important and even having to ask for something to be done due to the long wait fails to meet \""""great customer service\"""".

"Although this little spot is only a half mile from my work, I had never noticed it until Groupon ran a special recently.  So glad I found it!\n\nSince we had a groupon, we decided to order a few extra things to sample the menu.  We started with the chicken salad.  It was SO good.  Not too much dressing/mayo, and a nice fragrant hint of rosemary with sliced grapes.  It would have only been improved by having a huge hunk of bread on the side.  We shared a bowl of the cheddar bacon potato soup.  It was pretty tasty, but nearly caused 3rd degree burns - it was waaayyyy too hot!  We wished that it had been a little chunkier, and seemed like it would've worked even better as a cheese fondue dip!  Next up was the peppercorn burger, ordered with the addition of bacon and white cheddar, based on the advice of our server, Nicole.  She was an absolute rockstar - she had lots of suggestions and was a great help navigating the menu.  Her advice was spot on - the peppercorn burger was amazing!  Also on her advice, I sampled the Morning After drink (pear vodka, elderflower liqueur, fresh lemon juice, and champagne).  It was spectacular and very, very strong.  Perfection! \n\nIt was such a great experience, that we will surely return - with or without a groupon in hand!",1,1
I was pretty disappointed on this visit. The food was great but the service sucked. We had to wait a while and the server did not really interact with us. I ordered an appetizer that never arrived and the server acted like he did not even know I ordered it. Maybe he should write down what his customers ordered instead of relying on his memory. It seemed like he was there to just do his eight hours and then get out of there. After we finished our meal he took the plates but the rest of the table was still a bit messy. We ordered dessert but we had to clean the table ourselves just to make sure it was clear.I don't expect an immaculate table but at least make an attempt to make sure the table will be ready for when my dessert arrives.

"Holy cow I am so glad I was talked into coming here and trying it out. I was a little apprehensive at first since I was not sure what this place entailed. If it is your first time there the servers warn you not to expect large portions and suggest you order several plates if you want more of a variety. With this in mind I ordered the shrimp risotto and the salmon. The risotto came with jumbo shrimp and was a little more al dente in some parts than I would have cared for but was still good. I also ordered the grilled salmon which was ok on its own BUT to me what really made the plate outstanding was the bed of oyster mushrooms that the salmon was served on. The combination of the salmon and the mushrooms makes this plate a must try. I was sufficiently satisfied after both of these plates. My dining companion ordered the half roasted chicken. Unfortunately, the plate lacked the wow factor the salmon had, and the chicken lacked any flavor on its own, and the broccolini it came with was way overcooked and inedible. We ended up having to add salt to give the chicken any flavor. The manager also surprised us with a mini cheesecake for my birthday (yay!), which I thought was nice. To top off the meal I had a Smith & Forge hard cider (yum!) and my companion had some drink (can't remember the name) that had raspberries in it. Unfortunately, the bartender who made it forgot to strain the seeds out, making it impossible to drink, and it had to be sent back. I had to knock a star off for the lack of flavor in the the chicken and the inconvenience of the drink. Would I come here again? Absolutely. Would I recommend you give it a try? Absolutely!",1,1

I went for my first time to this nail salon and I will never go back.  The woman who did my nails talked the entire time to other manicurists in Vietnamese or whatever which in itself is rude and makes one feel paranoid that they are being talked about.  That would have been tolerable if the manicure itself had been worth it but it was a terrible manicure that lasted two days at most and some nails are are chipping and jagged already. I am a once a week client of manicures so my nails have been very well taken care of- until this week.,0,0
"Decided to take a short trip downtown to try the Central Coast Wine Tasting event held here last week.  We had a blast!  While the rep that hosted the wine tasting made the wine tasting a fun and informative event, we really enjoyed the atmosphere and FOOD! \n\nThe tapas plate that came with the wine tasting was fabulous, blue cheese and bacon stuffed dates, a super tasty California cheese (bought some to take home) and a tiny, but very yummy shrimp salad. That only made us want to try more!  \n\nJeannie loves scallops, so naturally she ordered the Scallop Martini.  I know deep down she did not want to share, but she graciously fed me one of those monsters.  She said they are the best she has ever had and I have a hard time arguing with her.  Three big, tender, perfectly cooked and seasoned scallops resting in a Martini glass.  The accompanying sauce was absolutely delicious.  We also ordered a single cheese plate with a cheese from Spain, Mahon (I think).  Loved that one too, so of course we bought some to enjoy later. \n\nWon't wait for a wine tasting to make our return....",1,1

"Second time at this place and the food is just lack luster as last time. The Piled High Nachos were dry as a bone and the chips were burnt! The small amount of cheese they provided had solidified by the time they got to the table. The shredded beef tasted of nothing and was dried the f**k out! How could they screw up such a simple dish. I'm trying to have a good time with friends and that sad pile of nachos was too depressing to look at. I told them to take it back. I won't even get into the service it wasn't terrible, but why bother.\n\nI'm coming to realize that  Mexican food served on the Vegas Strip does not do any one any favors. Everyone thinks Mexican food should be good, priced fairly and served in an adequate portion. Fast service and free chips and salsa are just par for the course. El Segundo Sol never scores high in any of the categories. Ever!\n\nI heard of a happy hour and the bartender said it's only outside at Stripburger (same company) in the cold, dreary rain. She actually recommended we sit outside in the cold rain by heat lamps! What's wrong with people?",0,0

"TRAINWRECK!!! \nProof positive that it ISN\""""T just Location! Location! Location! \nWhile Koi has an excellent home at the heart of the strip...\n The ambiance is dark, the management are non-existent, and the food is sub par and completely overpriced. The only saving grace was that the drinks were strong and the staff were all to eager to give away cocktails for free as compensation for their ineptitude and/ or indifference. For such an empty restaurant, one might expect reasonable service and fresh food. However, our oysters smelled rancid and steaks were unrested with blood mixing into the sauce all over our plates. Eeeeewwwwww! \n  Our server was inattentive and our attempts to have our issues addressed by the arrogant asian manager walking around casually were abandoned when someone from our party finally caught a glimpse of him, sitting by himself at a table in the dining room and staring at his iphone for no less than 15 minutes. Pathetic! While we stared at inedible food he never made it over to ours or anyone else's table to check on their experience... At least we all got a good laugh, after our free drinks, at how little anyone really seemed to care that we were there to exchange our hard earned money for a meal... what a unique concept-\n  Ultimately we wrote the experience off as a total loss and won't be back to Koi any time soon. Hopefully they get their S#@! together and remember they are in the service industry. Times are tough and you aren't exactly exceeding anyones expectations.

"Because of their restaurant policy, I give it two stars because of the bartender. \n\nI came here to do the bar menu and have a few drinks for my BIRTHDAY..I thought the bar menu was from 4:00-6:00pm but it was 3:00-5:00pm. We had arrived at 4:15pm and ALL seats at the bar were taken but there were small tables next to the bar that were EMPTY.  \n\nI asked the host if we could sit at one of the small tables and he informed us that ALL tables are for DINNER ONLY and it starts at 5:00 pm. ( he wasn't the most friendly) Well there goes that plan. No one would be leaving the BAR and then the menu would be over. I have never heard of a restaurant that ONLY provides seats at the \""""literal\"""" bar when they are serving their bar menu. Maybe they do things differently in CA.\n\nPlan B: Go to the Bellagio fountain show..which was wonderful as they had the show to the tune Lady Luck by Frank Sinatra..ahh...classic Vegas..on the way back, we walked past OLives and I thought well I have to at least get a birthday drink and they had 2 seats open. The bartender poured well ..got our money's worth, not watered down like most restaurants ( that is why I make my own most of the time). Didn't have dinner, too expensive and needed a reservation though the seating was practically empty for the tables..went to see the Monet exhibit and get dessert elsewhere..",0,1
This morning I give one star. I find it unacceptable to be waiting in the drive thru line with nobody else there at 6:03 in the morning having to wait 3 minutes for my order to be taken.

The line was 13 or so people deep so I waited and saw what I wanted I ordered the you pick two half of a sandwich and a cup of the Fire roasted tomato soup. The way they run this place is like herding cattle with not directions it's a cluster F.

"Since I go to college out here in Vegas, I am technically a local. And this nightclub is one of my favorites on the strip. The decor is nice. And the dance floor is small in comparison to like Tao @ the Venetian, Pure @ Caesar's Palace, and RA @ the Luxor. But on a Friday or Saturday night it has a pretty good crowd. Most of the crowd in there 20's and early 30's. Yes they have go- go dancers who pop up from time to time. The bartenders are nice, and all of the times I have been, my friend's have given me one of their VIP passes so we didn't have to pay cover.",1,0
"This place is great for your run of the mill, work downtown under 35 crowd.

Both were very good, and the bartender was very accommodating and attentive.\n\nOn the down side, this place got loud quickly, so I wouldn't recommend going there after 830pm if you want to have a conversation over dinner.",1,0

"I enjoy Jack in the Box. Probably too much for my own good. However, I will not be stopping at this location again, which is unfortunate as its the only one along my commute. I put my order in via the self ordering machine (love them!) And the gentleman before me ordered pretty much the same thing I did and had his food in hand within about 4 minutes. However, I got the wildcard of some guy walking in and ordering the same thing as me (the tacos are quite popular). Because he was 'in a rush' he got MY tacos and I got to wait a total of 11 minutes to receive my order. In no business is this okay. I guess if I do come back it'll be when I am 'in a rush' so I, too, can steal someone else'a food. The order was right and the place was clean. That's what the second star is about. The fact that I had to finish the rest of my bus/walk commute smelling of tacos and potato wedges was not the business.",0,0

"Mirage Nail & Spa was suggested to me over 2 years ago and I have been going back ever since.  \nMy \""""go to\"""" girl is Heidi.  She does the absolute best job on my gel manicures, pedicures and eyebrow waxing.  Pedicures last for months and my gel manicure always stays on for at least 3 weeks.  I constantly receive compliments on my nails.  She always remembers my name whenever I come in, which really makes you feel welcome.  She goes the extra mile and really takes her time.  I don't mind spending an afternoon at the nail spa, because I make time for it.  I think if you are in a hurry, you should let your manicurist know so they can try and work in your time constraints.\nI also enjoy getting my eyelashes done there.  They do eyelash extensions for a very reasonable price.  They last 2-3 weeks and look very nice.  I usually get them done for special occasions.  If they start to come out before the 2 week period, they will fix them for you.  I would ask for Van or Mimi to do your eyelashes.  They both do a great job.\nAlso, a bit of advice for people that don't like to wait to get service... make an appointment.  Yes, this place is busy.  Evenings and weekends are the craziest.  They are very popular, evidence of how great they are.  I've gone on a Friday evening and it's packed.  Even with an appointment, I had to wait 20 minutes.  I didn't mind though, because I would never go anywhere else.  They had to turn away people that just walked in.  Walk-Ins are welcome, but it's not guaranteed you'll get service.  Monday through Wednesday is usually a pretty good time to go.\nAnyway, if you are looking for a \""""Grade A\"""" place to get your nail and waxing services done, I really think you should give Mirage Nail & Spa a try.  :O)",1,0
"have been a customer for years as I was first introduced to Wally's when they first open by a very dear friend \""""Al\"""". At first opening they may have experienced a few growth pains but I was not aware of any and the food (lunch and dinner) I would put up against any fine restaurant like Wally's - and Wally's would be the clear winner. Remember reviews are that of one person (well intended I'm sure)  and may be as a result of only one visit so I think some of the negative comments I read should be taken with that in mind. My review is based on many visits over the years and is reflective of a composite of all those visits. The people/ staff at Wally's are outstanding - from ownership down to the newest hire. One thing I have noticed is turnover is a rarity at Wally's - speaks highly of the management and ownership in my opinion.

"An open letter to Primp & Blow: I am a real customer. Writing a real review. Stop accusing your competitors of writing nasty reviews, pay attention to what your customers are saying and fix your business. That's how it works.\n\nMy experience at your shop was just all wrong from the moment I arrived--so much so, that even my 12 year old niece, who was also getting a blow out, realized it. We compared notes and here is our honest, genuine review of Primp & Blow. \n\nThe okay: Open on Sundays, decent location, no wait when we were there, Bumble & Bumble product.\n\nThe bad: The stylists were ditzy, unprofessional and lackluster in general. The girl doing my hair actually stopped what she was doing to read over the iPad over my shoulder so many times that I stopped reading and switched to entertaining myself on my phone. She also, while doing my hair flirted with a maintenance man across the salon and hit me in the head with a blow dryer. She loudly and, in an accusatory tone, commented on any flaws in my cut or hair quality but drew a blank when I asked her for suggestions. \n\nThe ugly: My blowout lasted a few hours. It was pretty--that's about it. I paid extra just to have the stylist touch a curling iron for my blowout and my niece's so I did feel completely stilted. To my knowledge, this is the only blowout bar that charges extra for hot tools. The stylist didn't use any product pre-blowout and it showed. Checkout took forever. It was during that time that the woman working the front desk told me her suspicions about a competitor writing reviews on Yelp. \n\nThe bottom line: I've been to plenty of blow dry salons in the valley--this was by the far the worst.

He served us our free App.  After another 15 min or so after we finished, someone shows with our food.  THey served me the six dumpling plate when I ordered nine.  I mentioned that to the girl and she said she would tell my waiter.  When I was about half done with my plate, the waiter stops be and I mentioned this again to him.  He finally shows up with my other three dumplings about 20 minutes after I finished the original six!  \nI denied the other three and asked they be removed from the bill so we could get out of there.  A manager never showed his/her face.\nThe intrigue is gone.  We have lived and eaten in the Madison for ten years and have NEVER gotten worst service as we did last night.  No, We will never return.",0,1
"If you know me you know I love Las Vegas! So I hardly will find a place I can't have a good time at - as long as there is vodka, good vodka.\n\nI came here while in Las Vegas for work in early 1/2010. A few of us got out after our work commitments and thought we would check out the new hot spot. It isn't an easy location to get to if your cab driver isn't up to speed on the location then you will get dropped off in the wrong spot. A few in the group had to walk to whole mall - annoying! Once at the club the door gents were polite and got the 12 of us in quickly. Coming up the stairs to get to the club which is over Beso steakhouse you could already feel the sound system! I must stay ... impressive! I could feel the beat in my body all night. The girls working the bar are all beautiful and seem to be pretty nice and they poured some nice above average strength drinks. We danced the night away watched some animated porn footage - which was pretty funny and jetted out back to our hotel pleased with the location. The only thing I would have love was if it was a bigger location. It was raining pretty heavy when we were there so maybe it would be different if there was an outside area - didn't even bother looking. \n\nOn a side note ladies: Bathroom was clean and the ladies working in there were a blast - dancing and taking care of business!",1,1
"Gone down hill big time\nI have gone to this restaurant many times in my life. In the 60's it was a tavern and bait shop that had boat rental. I had not been to the Nau-Ti-Gal for years, and when my daughter and her BF came up from FL for Christmas we decided to take them there as it is a unique location and I in the past the food was pretty good. Saturday 12/27/14  we got there at 6:30 and the place was dead, which I thought a little odd. My wife ordered the seafood salad, my daughter, her BF and I ordered the Prime Rib special of the night, each meal came with a cup of clam chowder. My wifes seafood salad consided of canned baby shrimp, and canned crab meat on lettuce and tomatoes. The Prime Rib was a dark red color which I later realized was a Sam's pre-cooked Prime, I've had before. Later that night I got a gut ache, which turned into several trips to the bathroom, my wife got it the next morning, I'm thinking it was the chowder. \nI won't be going back to the Nau-Ti-Gal and would not recommend to anyone else...",0,0

"After reading glowing reviews on Handy Andy I went to his website and emailed him.   Didn't receive a response for a couple days.

Should have stopped there, but again thought maybe he was busy.   Got in touch with Andy on the phone a few days later and scheduled an appt for Saturday at 10:00.   AT 10:30, no show so I gave him a text and he said he was on his way.   It's now 12:30, no show, no call, no text return (sent him another text for an ETA).   What a waste of time!

"A coffee shop that serves frozen yogurt? This is my kind of shop! I can only review the frozen yogurt and atmosphere for now, but I will soon return and try the delicious sounding coffee. Recently I was in Downtown Phoenix and in dire need of a afternoon sugar fix. I was really hoping to enjoy a little cup of frozen yogurt to get me on my way and luckily I stumbled upon Red Hut Coffee! I set up shop for a bit and enjoyed the free wi fi at one of their several available tables and ordered a soft serve raspberry yogurt. They had a little selection of toppings to add to the order, so I decided to add some strawberries and fruity pebbles. They then weighed my ice cream and I paid using their iPad tablet. The process was seamless, the frozen yogurt was delicious and the atmosphere was perfect for a working environment.",1,1
"The new location passes the smell test!  We had the red curry chicken and the chicken pad thai.  I really liked the consistency, flavor and spiciness of both of the dishes.  They could have been a little more generous with the chicken and shrimp.  \n\nThe bathroom is nice and clean.\n\nI like the new location and I like the decorations.  However, they need to break the space up a little bit with some divider walls or hanging dividers and lights that come down from the ceilings on the tables.  It is a little too much like a big open auditorium.  \n\nThe service was fabulous!",1,1
"Ok so this is a sushi bar right? the salads and the regular menu was bigger than their sushi menu.  There was regular basic rolls and sashimi but very few specialty rolls.  I had the spicy tuna and one of their must have rolls, the Tootsy Maki.  The spicy tuna really lacked any kick as I like spicy, and the tootsy maki was supposed to have sauce on it and it was skimpy at best.  The kids got crab and cream cheese and it all fell apart and was just average.  The other child got sashimi and it came with radish noodles which was a nice dish.  Then the other mother got the tuna salad and it was nice but didn't seem anything special as limited tuna in it and a basic salad with tuna on top.  \nThe service was average as we had to ask for drink refills but she did check twice to see if we needed anything. I did have to ask for more ginger twice as well and we had to ask for chopstix helpers for the kids when most places offer if they have them.  The waitress was good answering questions though when she took our order but she hadn't tried and couldn't recommend the dishes we were asking about.  \nThe place was convenient as we were in the mall for the new Disney store but it wouldn't be my first pick for sushi where i would crave going back. I try to do sushi once a week but with sushi in the title of the restaurant i felt let down by their selection and the experience, especially for the price. Gave two stars as convenient if at fashion show, good view if sit outside and the food wasn't bad just not anything to stand out",0,1
"From the moment we arrived, we had a fantastic service experience.  The wine list is very good, with a lot of excellent choices from California.  They were happy to decant the heavier reds we ordered, and the stemware was well above average for restaurants.  My steamed mussels appetizer was good.  The duo of Berkshire pork was very well prepared, although the portion size was excessive.  The cherry bomb dessert was a little disappointing - the flavors were a little bit dull, and the sweetness overpowered everything else.  We had a fantastic time overall.",1,1

"Was stoked to see this little coffee shop while wandering PHX during a long layover.  The menu boards in the back showed Aeropress, Hario V60, Clever, and Chemex at MKT price, which was a definite surprise to se ein an airport.\n\nI ordered an Aeropress.  I was way too travel logged to really care about looking over their roasts, so went with the barista recommended Providencia.  Nice to see them doing an inverted brew on a gram scale, pre-moistening the paper filter, weighing out the water, and timing.  I didn't see them pre-warm the Aeropress, nor did they bloom the coffee.  Still, the coffee was solid, with a great nose (though maybe any coffee would have done the trick at that point in my travels), and worth the $3.25 market price.\n\nI'm a little surprised to see most of those brewing techniques in a high-traffic, speed oriented, environment like an airport.  My coffee definitely took a while (as expected), but I can't imagine what this place must be like when slammed (I was the only customer at 7 PM on a Sunday evening).\n\nRad to have this option in an airport environment, and it's a shame I didn't have the time/energy to explore their roasts.  \n\nDefinitely worth the jaunt to Terminal 4 if you've got a layover in PHX . .",1,1
"Had my wedding reception lunch here.  Service was gruff (maybe in effort to make this restaurant seem more authentically Italian) but the food was tasty.

All in all, I am 75% satisfied with this place.  If I were paying more attention, and not, you know, so focused on working the room, that percentage number might have been a little bit lower.",1,1
"My friends and I LOVE Wicked Spoon! We come here every time we go to Las Vegas. We've tried other well-known buffets and nothing compares! All the food is well-made, high quality, and presented beautifully. For example, the banger n mash (available at breakfast/brunch) has a dollop of mash , then the gravy poured over it, then the banger placed on top of that along with some steamed carrots for color (beautiful to look at and delicious) and is ready to grab n go. You will get excited to try it just by the way it looks. Practically everything looks FRESH and delicious! I haven't seen anything here that makes me think, \""""yuck, I don't think I should eat that...\"""" \n\nMost importantly to me, Wicked spoon has a lot of PALEO FRIENDLY FOOD! I got a plate of bacon, kale salad, pork belly, beets, artichoke hearts, and bone marrow! I scooped out the bone marrow , added a dash of salt, then mixed it into my kale salad. DELICIOUS! I would have got some prime rib, but I just don't like that cut of meat. The fattier the better, I say! This plate was just the first of a lot of different paleo-ish foods I picked.  Also, there is a fresh/custom omelet bar that will usually have a long line. I'll try that next time! The goodness doesn't stop at wicked spoon. Trust me, the long line is worth the wait!",1,0

I had to call my insurance company myself and put them on the phone with the front desk person in order to verify that my insurance was current. It is frankly not the customer's job to verify their insurance, and even the insurance person I called was surprised and mentioned that they have an online system for businesses to verify coverage online. The excuse I was given is that lately they have given eye exams to people who did not have current insurance coverage. As I stated before, this is not my problem as a customer and most other places simply verify coverage themselves before providing services. \n\nI would have just left but I made the appointment ahead of time and didn't want to bother rescheduling.

"I have brought my bike in for various reasons four different times and it has always been a solid experience for me. Once I brought our bikes in for a tuneup. I thought it was priced competitively and they did a fine job. In late 2011, I bought a helmut. The gentleman who assisted me was very helpful and also knew when to give me time on my own.  Recently I brought my bike in as I was riding home, because I kept getting flats on my back tire. Ron helped me and was very thorough. Not only did he fix the ongoing problem but he cleaned up my bike.  So I left with the problem completely fixed AND a shiny bike!  That's called customer service in my book-something sorely lacking in the US.   And I just brought it in again on Friday after a long ride because my odometer has not been working properly.  I thought they might be able to fix it for me. The tried but were unable to. Ron once again helped me. He sold me a very reasonably priced odometer that perfectly fits my needs. He did not oversell me. And because I didn't have enough cash on me, he allowed me to give him the cash I had on hand and call him to divvy up with my credit card when I got home. Yikes!

However the food, as this is a restaurant, should also be great and unfortunately it was not.  I ordered a red curry dish which sounded great but was disappointed at first bite.  It's not that it was bad because it certainly wasn't but it just wasn't great.  There seemed to be something missing that I was not able to put my finger on.

"Don't believe what you read about the famous Phoenician Sunday Brunch. Just another disappointment to the already overrated restaurant scene in or near the Scottsdale area.\nI had guests from out of town and decided to take them to the Sunday Brunch since I've heard so much hype about it from local reviewers. I, myself, have never been there but I thought this would be a good opportunity to check it out while entertaining guests. I mean, it's the prestigious Phoenician, so what could go wrong. \nThe Brunch is $45 per person, so you can only imagine what a grand display they would have. I mean, the Wynn in Las Vegas charges around the same and they have an amazing and elegant display of cuisines. At the Phoenician Brunch, the breakfast buffet portion of the brunch is just a hair better than the Holiday Inn complimentary breakfast (which is free by the way). They had custom made omelettes, cereal, assorted pastries, and standard breakfast fare (bacon, potatoes, eggs, and fruit). But that's it. That's all the breakfast buffet offered.\nThe lunch portion is a 3 course menu affair. It consisted of an appetizer, main course, and dessert. The appetizers offered sounded good but were not prepared very well. The main courses were decent but not for the price you pay. The desserts come out in a tower for the entire table to pick off of. They, too, were decent but not for the price you pay.\nThe only thing that the Phoenician lived up to its reputation is the service. It was exceptional and to the standard of the hotel. However, I wasn't paying for service. I wanted to pay for a high-end, quality brunch.

Your basically bending over backwards to have synthetic mink applied to your lashes with an extremely weak glue that causes your lashes to fall out during the first week and ride out having gaps in your lashes for the next few until your next fill. My current lashes do not budge at all even after 3 weeks they actually grow out with my lashes rather then gap and look ridiculous. This is problematic if your looking to save money and maintain a voluminous look. \n\n7. This is not the place if your looking to get creative with your lashes and build a relationship with your tech. There's too much scheduling issues and this business is about pumping out \""""basic lashes\"""" on any woman they can find in Vegas. It's simply all about the money sadly.\n\n8. It's just too over priced for what your getting. Look around and you'll find other lash places in Las Vegas if you want to make this be a regular part of your committed beauty regime. \n\n9. At one point a featherized fill was not enough to keep my lashes full due to there time slot regulations so I was forced to book a \""""fill plus\"""" plus a \""""mini fill\"""" on top just to maintain a full look that still only covered about 90% of my lashes! I was paying hundreds a week honestly just to maintain a \""""false eye lash look\"""". My current lash salon \""""beyond beauty\"""" gets all of my lashes filled in once appointment setting and I have no problems with gaps what so ever. The price is not astronomical as well. This place is really unforgiving, overpriced and lacks any type of luxury feeling for the customer for what you will be spending if you plan to spend a lot here be careful, you'll only be suckered into spending MORE. That's there objective. To make as much money possible in one day. If that's the type of business you want performing a service that involves time, creativity and personalization this is NOT the place to go!",0,0

"The Cupcakery is amazing!!!\n\nI was in Las Vegas with my family recently and we were on the hunt for cupcakes on Christmas Eve. Thanks to my handy dandy yelp app, we found The Cupcakery, and it was definitely a lucky find!\n\nFirst of all the shop is adorable, it's bright and full of character. The staff was awesome and extremely helpful. They were really patient with us as they explained their menu. They have a box of fresh samples and they give a generous sample size. \n\nThey have lots of different cupcake flavors, many of which were decorated in the holiday spirit. Some were so pretty that I didn't want to eat them....but of course my family and I did. We ordered a dozen cupcakes: Red Velvet, Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup, Brown Derby, their Chocolate and Vanilla Cupcakes, and a Cucumber Chocolate Chip cupcake. I tried the Red Velvet, Brown Derby, and Cucumber Chocolate Chip and I thought I hit the cupcake jackpot. They were moist, delicious, just the right frosting to cupcake ratio. The frosting complimented the cupcakes perfectly with the right amount of sweetness. \n\nGreat cupcake place! We will definitely keep this place in mind.",1,1
"My favorite place in Phoenix to grab a Perfect Pint. I think Guinness in an Irish pub just tastes better. And at Rosie's its even better thanks to the lively pub. My friends and I go come here whenever possible, its always a great time with great friends, great drink, and at a great place. Rosie's is that place where you always bump into someone you know. It makes this city seem just a little bit smaller. If you get there early enough for dinner, try the fish and chips, it's pretty tasty. But really, Guinness is a meal unto itself. Just grab a booth, sit back, and enjoy the night.",1,1
"Now, let me begin by saying I'm a blues guy and I like BB King. Ok, now let me continue by saying maybe BB is just an average cook with average taste buds. I'm just sayin'. I know he doesn't cook but...\n\nI liked the atmosphere, enjoyed the bartender's jokes and fun style, music was good, hey even the over-practiced, soul-less blues trio was good. But the food, unfortunately, was disappointing. I would rate it as decent and I swear it felt pre-prepared since it took less than a minute to get back to me. hmmm. Anywhoo, I was in Vegas and it seemed like I had to go visit BB's resto. \n\nI would recommend to see a band (some of upcoming musicians were solid) and say you've been to BB's restaurant otherwise the food was about average. - DanO",0,1
"If it was not for my amazing fianc\u00e9 (did someone just vomit in their mouth from my lovey-dovey comment?) I would have not found this place - and that makes me very sad. For Christmas I got a gift certificate for a Spa Mani/pedi at this place, which I did not use until May (don't judge me, my fianc\u00e9 already did).\n\nAnyhoo, I finally make an appointment and show up to a genuinely warm welcome from Sharie and the other staff members. We talk about the game plan, pick out colors, I drop my purse off on the cute little purse stands they have, and she got started on my pedicure first. I may be able to count on one hand how many pedicures I have had, but this was THE BEST pedicure I have every had and feel like my previous pedicures should have lived up to this experience and all future ones better watch out. Not only did it include nail polish, but rose pedals were added to the water, I got a sea salt scrub, and a bomb massage that lasted almost until forever. So amazing on the rare occasion I get a pedicure, I will definitely be calling Sharie up!\n\nI have gotten two gel manicures from Sharie and they both have held up pretty well. Sharie pays attention to detail and knows that my nails don't last long in my profession so when it came time to picking out colors, she told me which ones will last the longest and I greatly appreciate that. Sharie (and well, all the ladies) are so nice and friendly. Its a small salon so everyone is kind of talking to everyone and it feels like a close-knit community, which is something you do not get in those uber cheap chop shop salons. \n\nThe ONLY downside is the low occupancy this place has (3 pedi stations, 4 mani stations) and adding on a friend is almost impossible unless you make an appointment far in advance (which I suck at). As I said, I rarely get my nails done and when I do, I like to go with friends and its usually pretty last minute, which unfortunately, doesn't work with this nail boutique. \n\n I highly recommend Polished for anyone that likes to keep regular appointments, loves amazing pedicures and enjoys quality without the price tag!",1,1

"Are you a BRIDE thinking about having your wedding here? STOP!\nCan you give a place no stars? This place has HORRIBLE reviews of JUST the HOTEL, despite their so called \""""Renovations\"""" , so beware! And I'm not even complaining about their Hotel! This review (Or RANT ha ha) is for the EVENTS/WEDDING  department. STAY AWAY! wasted 6 months of precious planning time working with Janeen and Tricia from the Plaza.  I was given tours of the property and what was \""""coming\"""" and promised how awesome the new banquet rooms would be. My first mistake.\nI was even promised 2009 event food and booze pricing for my wedding because of the inconvenience of their renovations. Because of that, I decided on the Plaza. A few months later, I was finally suckered into signing a contract and giving them a 500.00 deposit.. Then, I finally SAW the \""""new\"""" banquet rooms. My BAD.\nThey were normal, boring banquet rooms, and most of the area in them wasn't even NEW, including the carpet! If that wasn't enough of a joke, the two vendor companies the Plaza referred me to, to help decorate my event, were shockingly unprofessional. \nOne, called Ltevention, never returned calls or emails over a one month period, and the other, a lady named Maya, scoffed at me as a client because I had 'GASP' a budget! (In this economy, can you IMAGINE?)\n She expected me to want to shell out over 6000.00 just for floor to ceiling draping to make the room, as she put it, more \""""stylish\"""" ....in addition to all the linens, flowers, etc., that I wanted. (Never mind that I thought that since the room would have been a lot more elegant as promised over and OVER by the Plaza, why would draping even be necessary? It is, after all, an OPTION!)\n Then, to add insult to serious injury, when I told her I wasn't interested in those types of items, just simple flowers, linens and chair covers, her whole attitude and demeanor changed. She got snotty! After several attempts to contact her to finalize the rental of the simple items I did want, she chickened out of any contact with me, and enlisted the Plaza to tell me that she \""""would not work with me.\"""" And this was a vendor that my contracted Hotel, the PLAZA referred me to!! What?! So basically, I don't have enough money in my lowly budget to waste your time....Well, sorry. LOTS of people are on a wedding budget and don't have 30,000 to spend on a wedding. As a couple, we are paying for all of this ourselves.\n I was appalled that in this economy ANY vendor in any type of industry could SCOFF at taking on a client, no matter their budget. Unbelievable. \nWhen I expressed my frustration to the Plaza about these two quacks, (that THEY referred me to, mind you) they were of no help. All I got was the \""""too bad that's the way it is\"""" song and dance. (Just more professional sounding and wordy.)Then they repeatedly tried to professionally distance themselves from these \""""outside\"""" vendors by saying just that... \""""They don't officially work for us, blah blah\""""..but who cares? Don't they have any sense of professional integrity? That fact remains that the Plaza assured me that they would take stress and frustration out of the process for me by referring vendors. What about THAT promise?\nBy that point, they had my 500.00 for only 16 days and JUST the day before I had been emailed menus so I could actually, after MONTHS, finally start planning what my guests could eat. But by that time I had a BAD taste in my mouth, especially about the crappy banquet room, so I respectfully asked for my deposit back, in writing. (Yes, I did write \""""respectfully\"""" in my written request. I can show it to you.) Not that I stood a chance.\nBecause of course, no respect was given. Sure, officially I signed, and I knew they were gonna take my money and run, but I thought maybe, just MAYBE, because of the way their vendors handled me, and the fact that up to that point the only thing I had planned with them was seeing their craptacular ball room and I was pushed around and ignored, that I could appeal to any sort of professional ethics they might have and just respectfully bow out, hopefully with my deposit. I was so wrong. So I'm out $500.00, but I'd rather be out that than work with this dump. They have greedily keep the 500.00 which they did not in ANY way rightfully earn. \nThey lied about their commitment to work with me. The contract should have read..\""""We will help you only if you spend much more than what was discussed on your event. If not, you're on your own.\"""" And just so my fellow yelpers know, I am so not a \""""Bridezilla.\"""" All I want is a great party! But if you want to keep it simple, the Plaza completely abandons you and just gives you four ugly banquet walls and food. \nOh, BTW, the whole place still stinks BADLY of cigarette smoke, just like in days of yore. Which is fitting. Cause they stink.",0,0
"Don't believe the hype! I won't say this place is awful, but it's nothing to write home about.\n\nI heard about BFG over a year ago, and I kind of forgot about it.

Don't expect to just walk in and get your food in a minute or two. You'll be waiting a few, especially if they are busy. It's completely worth it though..  the food was still steaming by the time I got to my house in the Aliante area. I was impressed.\n\nMy order consisted of baked chicken with honey mustard and BFG sauce, and the mac and cheese. The chicken was fine. Nothing that I couldn't prepare myself. The mac and cheese was completely disappointing! It looks so good from the pictures I've seen, but it was complete bland. A soupy mac and cheese covered in cheese. Boring! The best thing on my plate was the honey mustard sauce. That's kinda sad....\n\nThe service is awesome. The staff is really friendly! I think I paid just under $7 bucks, which really wasn't bad. I just wish the good was better.",0,0
"This place is usally packed with family or friends, but I have been fortunate to have never had to wait. I love the vegetarian options. My favorite is the tofu and asparagus.

I am excited to keep trying more options as I continue to live here in Charlotte. I will take my mom next month when she visits so I will update my review then. She is going to love it.

The good thing is, once your claustrophobia starts to act up, you can take a step out on a balcony that has a wonderful view of the strip.\n\nService was very good as a friend lost her phone there and security was all over it.

"I can't understand all the negative reviews for Macayos in Goodyear. YES, for those that don't already know this, Macayos is a chain. It's a family owned chain and as far as I know, they're only here in Arizona, centered around the Phoenix area. They've been in business many years.\n\nMy family loves Macayos, and we've been to several. I just ate at the one in Goodyear today for lunch - I had a colleague in from out of town and he was up for some Mexican food, and he said he enjoyed it. We both had the Chimi Macayos, with shredded beef, rice and beans (lunch comes with one or the other but you can add the other for a buck or two). \n\nTheir chips are good, the salsa is good (not great, I admit, but good) and they serve portions large enough to satisfy any hunger. Seriously, if you eat here and leave hungry, you're one in a thousand.\n\nThey have a nice bar area, and on Friday and Saturday nights it gets pretty busy.

"Pacino's fell short on all requirements of a good restaurant. So it is Valentines Day night. I called in ahead of time and asked about the wait time, a discombobulated hostess shouted about in my ear trying to find out who could clean tables and how long and finally tells me they have one table open. We were there in a matter of only 5 minutes and saw plenty of open tables but shrugged it off. We waited while the table cleared and were sat down. After waiting nearly 25 minutes I finally caught the attention of a hostess and asked when we could expect to see our server and if we could see a menu. It is only now that I am told no menus are available that I can only opt in for their $40 per person 4 course pre fixe meal and neither one of us are 4 course hungry. I just asked that she have the server come over to the table to talk with us. *now quick side note I am an extremely observant person so when we were waiting for a table to clear earlier at the hostess desk I noticed the woman who should have been our waitress crying and being consoled by a girl near the front desk. Now I also have an empathetic heart and had felt sympathy for the woman when I saw this but if she had something going on that was interrupting her ability to work she should have gone and spoken with her manager for a solution*  Our waiter finally did come over and asked if we had questions about the pre fixe, I mentioned that we had never been told it was the only option and asked if we could order al a carte from the options available for the night. I was very kind yet firm in my request and before I even finished I got an onslaught of excuses, \""""the computers can't input that\"""" \""""we don't have the capability\"""" he even went as far as to begin to explain their food coding system and then finally did the right thing and said \""""let me check to see if that is possible\"""" his frustration showed through his voice and eyes but he came back and let me know they could and then inflated the al a carte prices pretty exorbitantly $25 for 5 shrimp raviolis $23 for their chicken with squash and scalloped potatoes on the side. His service got better as the night progressed and as he understood that my appreciation for him accommodating the request was not fake. My date said his food was good and mine was seeming the same until I bit into the middle of the ravioli and found that the center on each of them was still ice cold. I should have said something but I didn't, I was just tired from the day and the escapades already so I ate them avoiding the center on each. The food was good, minus the frozen centers, but I have to be honest in saying that Alessia's Ristorante Italiano down the way is of much better quality, taste and most importantly service. I also wanted to discuss the attitude of the owner, or at least I assume he was an owner or manager. He wore brightly colored red/orange pants with a striped orange shirt and graciously greeted every guest around us except our table. This was absolutely appalling! He even stopped by a table of what appeared to be regulars several times, laughing and personally removing their finished plates. I have a background with customer service and so I decided to give him a chance as not to misinterpret the body language of our table and looked him dead eye until he saw me and still I got nothing, not a polite head nod or a simple thank you. You really can not treat your guests like that, they have chosen to devote their time, money and valentines day to your restaurant and that is how you treat them? I think he is forgetting that his guests are who create their success, without us there won't be a need for what you have to offer. Any way, the only two good things I did experience were this, our waiters attitude finally turning around midway through our meal and I wish we would have been seated outside because I watched another waitress in a red dress hustling back and forth from the kitchen to the outside without skipping a beat giving her guests a great experience on their valentines day. I could tell because each person I could see through the open doors had a bliss filled smile on their face, the way everyone should have been made to feel that night.",0,1

"Wow, what a disappointing experience. My hubby keeps telling me to stop buying Groupons and I might start listening (cannot guarantee). I am not sure if it is because I had a groupon or not, however I didn't feel welcomed. I get my brows done next door by Koltton who is amazing.  First thing she told me was to wait in the waiting area since she was running late. Ok, my next appointment was not until noon so I was not too worried. 15 minutes later and I started getting nervous. I was about to text my next appointment when she came to get me at 11:05.  I was never given a cover up to put over my clothing, not even a dentist's paper bib. She just told me to lay down and she started removing my make-up, then a little rubbing of something else.

"This was the second time I've been to Bliss. The first time I ordered the Grilled Cheese with Pears, the second time I just went for dessert.  Both times I was disappointed.  The grilled Cheese with pears was small, and didn't have a side.  For 7 dollars I thought it was overpriced, and nothing I couldn't have made at home-just some cheese, slapped on sourdough bread, with some pears.  This past time I had the Brownie Sundae and  it was not very good at all.  The brownie was extremely dry and severely lacking in that chocolatey taste.  The ice cream was good, but I also suspect it wasn't homemade-so that was probably why it was tasty.  There was some carmel drizzled on top of the ice cream with a sprig of mint. That was it. For $6.50 it was way overpriced and the brownie sundae is definitely something I could have made (better) at home. \nThe ambiance at Bliss is great though, and there isn't much noise.\nThe service was alright, nothing to write home about. \nI would recommend if you're absolutely starving and there isn't anywhere else to go.

"As a hookah frequent, I have to say Harem has to be the biggest waste of money iv ever spent at a hookah lounge.  The other reviews are pretty accurate. The wait staff sucks, oh wait...there's only ONE employee ever working (if that qualifies as a wait staff). The hookah is always too harsh. The quality of shisha is nothing to write home about. ONE hookah and two waters totalled 35.00 !!! & when I handedn the cashier 40.00 in 20 dollar bills he asked me if I had exact change because he had no twenties or ones. Like I stated before,  waste of $$$. It only gets one star because the decor is cute. But then again, id rather sit in a basic lounge with good shisha and fair prices. Fail.",0,1
"I love this place, a stand-by for happy hours.  The beer selection is amazing and the food is top-notch for bar grub.\n\nComing here with a group and knowing a little bit about beer is gonna get you points with any crowd.  Want a nutty brown ale, you got Moose Drool.  Not a beer fan?  Recommend the Lindeman's Framboise.  Want to class it up with a Belgian?  They got everything from Chimay to Gulden Draak.  Beer to impress.\n\nFor food, I would recommend the Bernaise Sliders.  Nice rib-sticking bar food that anybody can enjoy.  Will be back frequently!",1,1
"Note: the museum is tiny, tiny, tiny.... You can see the whole place in less than an hour, easily, but it's definitely worth the trek to the northside.\n\nThis is a modern art museum, which definitely takes an interesting take on what modern art is (I guess modern art is always undefined, anyways). The top  floor holds the temporary exhibits, so it's nice to start there and work your way down. When I was there a couple months ago they had some massive wood sculptures carved from tree trunks and one big installation which was basically a big hole that overlooked the neighbor's backyard. Very interesting. \n\nMy absolute favorite thing is the light exhibits on the 2nd floor. Take your beau and grab on. It's terrifying and fun at the same time. The one exhibit takes about 15-20 to show-up, but definitely wait it out. It's worth it. Don't forget that there are 2 other buildings outside with more to see that only take a minute or two to see. \n\nFYI - there's no good way to get there via public transport, so hopefully you have a car.",1,1

"Sensational Food, Spellbinding View\n\nThe Fountains Brunch at Jasmine may be the best Sunday brunch you've never heard of. In comparison to the more famous Sterling Brunch across the Strip at Bally's, many people aren't aware that on Sunday, Jasmine in the Bellagio opens at 11 a.m. for a luxe, Cantonese/dim sum/all American breakfast brunch. The room is decorated in florals and creams... it's a bit old lady, but never feels stuffy, especially with sunlight streaming through the windows on a bright morning. Better yet, the room's floor-to-ceiling windows overlook the Bellagio fountains, which go into overdrive especially for brunch patrons. Fountain music is pumped into the room every 15 minutes as the fountains perform. \n\nOutside of the fountains, the centerpiece of the brunch is a fantastic buffet. It's not massive, but there's a wide variety of superbly prepared dishes. Traditional american brunch favorites are here, with the usual Bellagio-classy twists: the belgian waffles are red velvet, the eggs benedict are served on a lobster-potato cake. There's an excellent raw bar, a selection of caviar and sushi, and awesome cold bites and cheeses.There's also an omelet station, but a better choice is the soup, where a chef customizes asian-style noodles to your liking. The carving station has huge chunks of beef, lamb, and incredible carved slab bacon. The dim sum components are great too: sui mai, short ribs, crystal prawns. Best of all, they serve fantastic peeking duck table side in steamed buns. \n\nThe finale of brunch is a room devoted to desserts, and unlike many buffets, these are made in small batches by the pastry team and are quite good. Additionally, the pastry chef on staff chats and explains the different desserts, what was particularly good that day, and what ice creams and gelatos they've prepared. \n\nDownsides: it's not cheap ($80ish), and unlimited champagne is an add-on. (They have different levels of sparkling wines, and I believe the lowest was about $15?) I think they add gratuity automatically, but the service was so good when I went that my boyfriend and I ended up tipping more. \n\nOverall, this is a truly not-to-be-missed morning in Las Vegas. Make reservations, go hungry, and prepare to spend a few hours indulging yourself. If nothing else, this is probably the classiest way to deal with a hangover on the Strip.",1,0

"I know Fuel is predominately a pizza joint, but as much as I love their pizza, the one thing they do best is buffalo chicken wings. There are a few staples that one needs in life and for me a need for crispy, hot buffalo wings, drenched in cool ranch dressing, is a craving that hits me often. I will search high and low to find the perfect wings and thankfully, they can be delivered to my doorstep by Fuel (no matter what time it is). \n\nTheir wings have the best balance of spicy sauce to crispy skin. They offer a variety of sauces, but my favorite is the classic hot. Some people may complain that it is too spicy for their taste, but I think it packs just enough heat to break a sweat, but not too much to leave me hurting. I love to order my wings extra crispy, because there is nothing better then the crunchy bite of the skin before getting to the soft meat of the wing.  \n\nI can be a pain in the butt and ask for my wings to get a little extra attention (more specifically, some fresh chopped garlic and a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese) sometimes, but Fuel always puts up with my requests. They even know people can be picky about their carrots vs. celery and will let you customize your order to be \""""all celery\"""" or vice versa. \n\nI prefer to eat in when ordering wings, because they fry the wings upon ordering and I am ready and waiting to get my hands on them, but on a lazy Sunday (or late Saturday night) I will request a delivery of my order. My only complaint is that the Styrofoam boxes that the wings are packaged in tend to create perspiration and reduce the crispiness of the wings. If they could poke holes in the top of the box to let the wings breathe, life would be just perfect. \n\nI dare you to find a better wing in Charlotte.",1,0

"I've been here 3 times for a group happy hour. \n\nThe first time, it was excellent.  Had a great waiter who stayed on top of things and even came over to remind us about happy hour ending and to see if we wanted any more drink orders so he could get them in before the cut off.\n\nThe second time, it was a bit worse.  We had a large group, and took up the entire patio.  However, there was only 1 waitress for about 40 of us.  She forgot orders, brought out wrong things, and had no idea who ordered which thing.  She overcharged me too many drinks that had already been paid for.\n\nBut since they have decent food, and GREAT prices during happy hour, we decided to come a third time.\nApparently the manager didn't appreciate our business because he immediately asked when we would be leaving.  He said that we take up the entire patio and no one else can sit out there because we take all the seats.  Mind you, every single person there is a customer.  Every single one of us ordered multiple drinks and plenty of food.  It's not like anyone was just sitting taking a seat, but not paying for anything.\nThis manager was so rude, that my co-workers debated leaving right then.  We will definitely not come back again.  We also do a fund raiser with them and our school once or twice a year.  We are planning on canceling that.\n\nThey have lost our business now, which is unfortunate.\n\n\nIf you have a large group, go elsewhere.  If you are looking for cheap drinks, and there's only a few of you, this is an okay place.  The pretzels are cheap and okay, nothing special.\n\nMy major compliment is that they have Wyder's Pear Cider, which is my favorite!",0,0
"The Griddle has a HUGE menu, so be prepared for that when you arrive.  My friends and I dined on a Sunday evening and had no problem walking up to get a table.  There's not a TON of variety anywhere on the menu except the pancakes.  The dining room is comfortable and really cuts off the casino floor noise, despite being directly next to it.  My friends and I ordered a mix of breakfast (omelette) and lunch/dinner (fish tacos and shrimp pesto sandwich) items and were definitely satisfied.  The only thing I would have enjoyed is more flavor in the omelette and accompanying breakfast potatoes.  Our server seemed a bit off her game, but we all have off days, so we wrote that off.  If you're looking for a unique dining experience in a Strip casino, check out The Griddle.  I'm sure you won't be disappointed!",1,1

"This place has been on my radar for three months now. I finally made it for lunch a few days ago, and I have to say -it was a disappointing experience.\n\n  I chose menu item F-6 (Spicy Thai Holy Basil with chicken) -which was stir fried chicken, onions, chili, and Thai holy basil leaves. The chicken itself was sliced -not ground and was a little tough and dry. The dish appeared to be swimming in grease -instead of a sauce. I didn't know sliced chicken could be greasy... \n\nThe level 3 spice out of 5 barely registered as spicy, and as a result the food was bland. Why do most Thai places skimp on basil? I thought this was a dish that featured basil?  Instead, I found myself on the hunt looking for basil underneath the rubbery overcooked chicken. \n\nThe restaurant itself is clean, quaint, and inviting. My order was done in 10 minutes which was nice considering I was on my lunch break. However, I would rather they took their time to make sure the dish actually tasted good. \n\nI won't come back as there are just too many good Thai places to choose from in Las Vegas.",0,1

"So, I used to think this place was reasonable.  Being from California, I've missed good Mexican food so much that I sometimes find myself saying things like, \""""Maybe Chipotle really isn't that bad...\"""" or things like that.  And for a while, Cuzamil kept me from tearing my hair out when all I wanted was some greasy, hole in the wall Mexican food.  Cuz when I say I want Mexican, that's what I want - not the fresh ingredient gourmet stuff that they serve at Cantina, but the greasy spoon stuff that is dirt cheap and is essentially what you are craving after a good night out on the town.  I'm not talking foodie stuff here.\n\nAnyway, so Cuzamil used to satisfy that for me.  But I went recently and man was that pretty bad.  I ordered the enchiladas especiales, which were supposed to come with avocado salad (which is really the only reason I got it).  What I got were two enchiladas that were gooey, tasteless, the tortilla was chewy and clearly stale... and no avocado salad.  I asked about it, and the server came back and said they didn't have any avocado.  So... lemme get this straight.  You don't have a major ingredient, and you're not going to ask the patron if they want to change their order?  AND you're going to charge them as though they got the entree they wanted, rather than two lifeless enchiladas, which are much cheaper?  Someone's business radar was clearly broken.\n\nSo, sure I'm a little bitter.  But given that I wasn't super hot on this place before, this little incident ensures that I'm not going back again.",0,0

"Don't go here!

Noisy! We had Debbie Downer for our waitress who never smiled and saw her only three times: once to take our order, another time to deliver food, and a final time to deliver the check. Um, can we get refills? She even messed up on the drink order: coffee. How do you forget coffee during brunch? \n\nFood:\nI ordered lox and a bagel. Can't screw that up, but I will say that the bagel was small and they only gave my three rings of onion - not even a full slice of an onion! That lox and bagel was NOT worth $15. The cream cheese portion was not much...maybe a tablespoon. The tomato slice was a regular beef steak, not vine ripened and the tomato was pill-y. However, the lox was good. My bro ordered the corned beef hash which was good and meaty, and the hash browns were tasty and crunchy. Our meal came close to $70...for breakfast. \n\nWhy two stars?\nThe service is bad as is the food. Avoid this place and hit the buffet or eat at another hotel.

"Reviewing airports? Guess I was compelled to after being yelled at by the annoying, power tripping, airport staff lady who thought it was okay to bark at anyone trying to avoid her escalator line control on the way up to the TSA security line. For a city dependent on people dumping their money on the strip, you'd think they'd up their efforts to provide a better gateway and experience to their patrons.\n\nThen again, the airport is okay at best most of the time especially when you think about the trainwreck that JFK & LAX can be. McCarran doesn't seem that bad anymore. Talk about low standards.\n\nArriving at McCarran is usually a smooth affair, the walk to the heavily advertised, spam filled baggage claim can be pretty fast even in the narrow corridors throughout the airport. Getting a taxi or shuttle is straightforward and the airport shuttle to the car rental center is a breeze & really convenient.\n\nLeaving is bit more difficult. Crowded check in terminals with not much space to move, long TSA lines, and not enough seating at the gates which are probably too close to one another. However, these complaints are all pretty trivial since it could be far worse in my past experience.",0,0
"I just moved here from out of state (grew up near nyc), and after living here for a few months I've decided this is one of my favorite restaurants in Madison. There's a few reasons why:\n\n1. I'll start off with the fact that this place has far-and-away the best cheese curds I've tasted yet. Granted I'm not a Wisconsin native, but I can appreciate good food when I see it. The Old Fashioned's curds are the tastiest, gooiest, squeakiest, and have the best texture of anywhere else I've been. They're a must-have, hands down.\n\n2. The atmosphere is perfect. It's the kind of place where you can feel comfortable in anything from a shirt and tie to a t-shirt and shorts. It has this rustic, busy feeling that feels both modern and, well, old fashioned. The energy in the place is always happy, probably attributable to point #1.\n\n3. The beer. I hear their cocktails are great too, but I haven't actually had them. I have, on the other hand, had several 12-snit beer flights there and I can safely say I've tasted everything they have on tap. The biggest thing is that their selection is almost entirely Wisconsin-local beers. I love that, even though (and maybe especially because) I'm from out of state. Their presentation (on giant slabs of wood) for the beer flights is pretty awesome, too.\n\n4. The food I've had there is the only thing I might hesitate on for the 5-star rating (I'd have preferred to give a 4.5). I love their Wurst Platter (which can easily feed 3 people for about $15), and some of their burgers are very good, but I've found the food to be extremely rich and hard to take more than a few bites of. If you're into that, right on. I have a little trouble getting through meals, though. Lots of food for relatively inexpensive cost. \n\n5. Everything else, like the service and the outdoor seating and the text system for getting a table. All outstanding.",1,0

It annoyed me that we paid over $100 for two people for OK food, and they were trying to convert everything over to club mode so we were rushed out and the end of our dinner was ruined with loud music.

The Dhaba is OpenTable friendly, so I made a reservation and we were sat immediately. We also found a Groupon, $18 for $30, so dinner was already $12 off before we walked in the door. \n\nIt was a Saturday night, around 7pm, and the place was practically full. My wife and I noticed that there were a lot of Indians eating here as well, which is always a good sign of authenticity! We couldn't help but notice the numerous placards and \""""Best of...\"""" awards hung all around the entryway. While this place was new to us, it certainly wasn't new to the area and has won many prestigious awards. \n\nThere was one hostess who also took orders while 3-4 other servers brought out food, refilled water, and pre-bussed the tables. We never needed a refill, never had dirty plates, and were always taken care of. This was a wonderful aspect of our dinner. My wife and I decided to try our favorite Indian staples: Samosas, Chicken Tikka Masala (Heat index - 6), Tandoori Chicken, Saffron Biryani Rice, and Garlic Naan. \n\nThe food was wonderful. My wife enjoys a milder heat so we settled with a 6 on all our dishes (out of 10). The heat was calm with just enough *umph* for her. The flavors were delightful as I mixed them together. Tandoori Chicken in Tikka Masala sauce with garlic Naan bites. Yummerz! The presentation of the dishes looked beautiful and the servers were attending to our every need. We were very impressed with the customer service.\n\nIf you are in the Tempe neighborhood and looking for a wonderful Indian food restaurant, please check this place out. They are outstanding.

The spot is locally owned, with a second location in Ahwatukee, and my pal and I got a nice table in the corner of the restaurant to enjoy the homemade Italian food at.\n\nWe both liked how there were wine racks dividing the main dining area from the bar area, and there were pretty paintings covering the walls, while the restaurant glowed in a soft yellow light. Our server was excellent and professional, and I'd say it's a great date place if you're in the area.\n\nWe started with the Portobello Reganato con Fontina ($8.95), a mushroom topped with cheese. Our server said it was one of their most popular appetizers, and I can see why: it was plenty of food for two people to split and had a ton of cheese. The mushroom was really juicy and brought a healthier aspect to the dish, and I really enjoyed it.\n\nOur meals came with freshly baked bread, and I ordered Ravioli Caprese Gratinati ($14.95). It was a pretty traditional cheese ravioli, and nothing really stood out to me about the dish, though my companion really liked the fresh tomato sauce it was smothered in. The pasta was thick but a great consistency-there wasn't anything wrong with it, but I've just had more memorable meals.\n\nMy guest got the Vitello Madeira con Porcini ($18.95), which was veal covered in a mushroom wine sauce and served with pasta. He said he would have preferred a cream sauce instead, which is totally available to you, but he really liked the veal.\n\nFor dessert, we had the epic chocolate tiramisu the spot offered. It was a giant slab of my favorite dessert, and it tasted pretty heavenly. Definitely get it if you go here-I could have eaten the whole thing myself!\n\nMy favorite part about dining at Arrivederci was definitely the atmosphere and the service.

"We had both lunch and dinner here Saturday as we were staying in the Marriott next door and it was so convenient.  Also, the lunch was good, making the dinner decision seem easier.  The Bistro Salad with Grilled Chicken was good at lunch; the earth didn't move, but it was pleasant and hit the spot.  My son liked his hamburger, my wife didn't complain about her sandwich.  But dinner.....  What is with waiters' and busboys' insane desire to grab every plate that is less than half full of food??  And when you have to interrupt your meal to say don't take that plate, I am still eating that food that you can see on it -- and when you have to do this at least TWICE!! -- I feel ashamed that I left a normal tip.\n\nWithout the decent lunch (later than normal time, so the restaurant was not crowded), this would be a one-star review.  My dinner entree of Mixed Grill was disappointing.  I guess I should have let those guys take it away!  The vegetable stir-fry was pathetic -- tasteless, undercooked, dullsville.  The filet chunks were fine and the mushrooms.... well, if I have to describe mushrooms, it could not have been a very inspiring dinner, could it?  The waitstaff needs a reeducation class.

Though I'd been training in kickboxing for about 6 months I'd picked up some bad habits.  Matthew brought it back to basics for me and pushed me until I had given up nearly every shred of energy I had.  He's got a great demeanour without being forceful, making me want to work harder and harder, and he's got a great eye for body alignment, showing me subtle ways to get more out of my movements.  \n\nNext time I'm back in Montreal, however brief, I'll be sure to book a training session with him again.",1,1
"I am a huge steak fan. I love eating it out and I love grilling it at home. however, a general disclaimer, I am not a food snob or overly picky. I have been told by multiple people that I \""""had to try Durrants\"""". We ordered an old fashioned and oysters to start. (This is the reason i am giving this review two stars instead of one). The oysters Rockefeller were amazing and I highly recommend them! Also, I haven't had a good old fashioned since I moved to Arizona, and the bar tender really knew his bourbon and the drink was outstanding. Then we put our dinner order in.... I got the 18oz ribeye and my uncle got the bone in ribeye. I asked for Mac and cheese instead of soup and the same for a side. I was instead served clam chowder. My uncle is a huge chowder fan and was excited to try it. I let the slip up go and decided to go with it as well. It was like a bowl of salt with some clam on top. Our waiter noticed we didn't eat any of the chowder and we said politely it was salty, and nothing was done about it. Next the steak came out. We both asked for mid rare. My uncle was rare, mine was medium. Also, I am a salt-aholic. I am that guy who will eat steak with a salt shaker in my left hand to make sure every bite gets a portion. The steak came out to the table overly salty to my taste. Also, the cut of meat was flabby (not marbled as it should be, I understand it is supposed to be fatty, that's why I love ribeye). This was fatty in the \""""I bought the cheap one at Wal-Mart kinda way. For a 166 dollar bill, I will not be back.",0,1

The next morning my son was violently ill, puking all over the place, and I will spare you the details of everything else, but he had food poisoning.  I called Streets of New York to tell them about it, and was met with a rude manager that questioned me to death, and didn't think that it was their food that made my son sick! Maybe if I didn't work as a chef, then I may have had it wrong, but I told the manager that I worked with food on a daily basis, and she still seemed to think that either I was making it up, or I was jsut wrong.

There was a broken ironing board in one of the rooms and they were so apologetic that they had to change it (although none of us were planning to use it) they brought a ton of extras as comps.\n\nThe beds are amazingly comfortable and I slept extremely well for what little I did sleep in Vegas (haha...) and the bathroom is INSANE!

It would have been nice for customers and workers to have some AC going.  Anyways, I picked up my pizza and went home to devour it. \n\nMy review:  \n\n- The garlic knots, although extremely delicious on the outside, had no flavor whatsoever on the inside.  The garlic sauce they offer with it was extremely helpful as I had to drench the bread in the middle with it.   I must say though that I'm amazed at how flaky it is on the inside and warm and gooey on the inside.  Big brownie points!\n\n- The pizza itself was very interesting.  It seemed like they tossed all my toppings into the center so while working my way to the crust, I had a mouth-watering explosion of flavor!  Yum!  But like the garlic knots, the dough itself offered very little flavor.\n\nOverall, it wasn't bad for the price.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't good.  It really seems like Gus is a water-downed cheaper alternative to NYPD Pizza!\n\nOh, and as a note, they charge 50cents if you use a credit card and a 49cents \""""service fee.\""""  I picked-up the pizza.

I aksed for the lox cream cheese.  Instead of putting the cream cheese on the toasted bagel they filled this 1/4 lb tub container (way too much for a single bagel) with the stuff and then charged me an additional $2.25 for the cream cheese.  Their explanation was lox cream cheese is a specialty item and they have to charge more...  however it seems odd to me that a) cream cheese is included in the price and they would not charge me extra for the regular cream cheese they smear on so why is it they have to charge for a 1/4 tub of specialty cream cheese and b) the difference between $2.25 and $1.50 ( for a 1/4 lb tub of regular cream cheese) is $0.75 cents so why are they just not charging me that difference.  Neither the clerk or the manager had good answers just that was what the charge was...\n\nDunno if I will be back as I do feel ripped off.  Its too bad becuase I really liked their bagels.\n\nSo be pre-warned!! If you order any specialty cream cheese they wont tell you upfront about the increased charge!!!",0,0

"Let me preface this by saying I got the all day buffet for free, and normally it runs $38. And free food always tastes anywhere from 2-2.5x better than food you pay for. \n\nOur first day in Vegas we hit up the Studio B Buffet at the M Resort, so needless to say More at Luxor was a step down...literally because the place is located in the basement of the Luxor. That said, it is easily the best food I've ever eaten inside of a basement. \n\nIf you stick to the normal food here, it's hard to find much to complain about. First we had the breakfast buffet and the sausage, eggs, bacon, and omelette bar were solid and great for filling up to start the day.\n\n There were only two things on the breakfast buffet that were so bad I couldn't swallow a bite: the biscuits and gravy, and the sausage and egg \""""burrito.\"""" I don't know what was inside of that so-called burrito, but it damn sure wasn't anything I would ever use at home. The biscuits and gravy was more bland than disgusting, and after a night of downing straight shots of tequila with no problem, it should say a lot that I didn't have the courage to take more than one bite of their hard biscuit or nasty gravy. \n\nFor dinner, it's pretty much standard Hometown Buffet or Golden Corrall food. Nothing here is going to blow you away like you would find at Wicked Spoon or Studio B, but  there are a few tasty items to be tried. First, the Buffalo Shrimp are pretty amazing. I've never had Buffalo Shrimp but I had to have eaten 2 plates of the shrimp alone. Second, the carved turkey was very good and paired with the mashed potatoes and gravy, I have to say was surprisingly Thanksgiving-like. So definitely some decent food for dinner to be had but there were more than a few duds. \n\nThe pizza - Imagine if Digiorno came out with a new pizza called \""""Flavorless.\"""" That's More's pizza in a nutshell. The crust and texture were Digiorno, but the sauce and everything else tasted like moist paper towels. \n\nThe Chicken - I don't know how you fuck up chicken because it has to be up there with scrambled eggs on the list of \""""The Most Impossible Foods to Ruin\"""" but More manages to do a great job at doing a poor job preparing chicken. Tons of fat, no flavor, gooey texture, etc. It tasted the way I would imagine chewing on a human kidney would be. \n\nSo all in all, More is great if you can get it at a discount and stick to basic foods offered in order to recharge your batteries and get something in your stomach. However, if you're spending the full $26 to get int he buffet, I would suggest the extra $14 at Wicked Spoon or heading down the road to Flamingo's Paradise Buffet for the same price.",0,1

"What a fantastic find this place turned out to be.  An enterprising coworker of mine got this recommendation from the bartender at the hotel bar.  And let me say to Darren - great job, sir!\n\nThe ambiance and decor of the restaurant were perfect - a nice spot with a good energy.  \n\nService was also very good.  Our waitress was very helpful in finding us a nice tempranillo that the whole table liked, and it was still a great price for a bottle of wine.  She also helped with a number of suggestions for our food.  Although it seemed like she suggested half of the menu, after eating everything, I suspect that she wasn't far off in liking as many items as she did.  Bonus points for the pacing of our meal, which was great.  They did a good job giving some time between courses - I always appreciate a restaurant that will give you a little extra time to enjoy, as opposed to trying to turn tables as quickly as possible.\n\nOn the food front - everything from start to finish was perfectly prepared, presented thoughtfully, and most importantly incredibly delicious!  I started with the Stetson Chopped salad, per out waitress' suggestion.  I'm not generally a huge salad person, but this was a super tasty salad.  All the components brought something to the table, and all were stars in their own right.  This is the kind of salad that would get me to eat more salad.  My entree was another of their small plates, the Berkshire Belly & Waffles.  The pork belly was cooked to perfection, and perfectly salty to complement the rest of the dish.  The waffles were made with Asian 5-spice, and went great with the pork belly.  Each piece was topped with a tamarind and chile compote, which was a nice sweet component on the plate, especially to cut through the salt from the pork.  It was a very unique plate of food that left me wanting more.\n\nFor dessert, the lemon doughnuts were a perfect dessert for me - since I love some lemon dessert.  The doughnuts were nice and light, and the lemon curd and vanilla sauces were spot on for me.  The perfect amount of sweet to close the meal.\n\nOverall - I would love to bring Cowboy Ciao back to Chicago with me, as it was a great dinner start to finish.  Since that isn't going to happen, it will have to be settle for being a must go to again next time I find myself in the area for business.",1,0

The guacamole was also very good - but the chips seemed like they were not so fresh.  They actually weren't even chips - they were full sized tortillas which you broke up to use as chips.  Also there was no salsa?  That was a bit odd - I know chips and salsa are a HUGE reason I go for Mexican food - they are my guilty pleasure.  I'll definitely be back though.",1,1

It's quickly becoming a pet peeve of mine that bars are not allowing patrons to be seated within the hours that they advertise on their doors.  Multiple patrons were still seated at the bar enjoying their drinks and yet I was turned away 40 minutes before Tender was supposed to close.  I suggest not going there late on a weekday night because it will be a waste of your trip.  The interior is unique and it is a bar I'm sure that is worth a visit once but the hours they list are deceptive.,0,0
"Great beer selection! Sure, the menu is \""""bar food\"""", but give it a try - the burgers and the peanut butter flat bread dessert are delish! We've had issues with service but I enjoy the beer and atmosphere too much to care. :) Oh - and the outside area is dog friendly!",1,1
"I went here for quite awhile and was always satisfied with their service. One day last summer, I walked in and saw the same lady that always did my eyebrows (I never knew her name).

I walked out in tears and to this day am shocked she has a job in customer service.",0,0
"My sister and I wanted to try this restaurant because we saw it at an episode of the \""""best thing I ever ate\"""" at the Food Network channel. There was a wait with people lining up. In about 20 minutes we were seated. I don't understand--What is all the hype about this restaurant? The food is nothing to rave about! The bbq chicken- ok- Ive had better ones! ; chow mein -alright; pork larb- disgusting! The only salvation was the Nam Prik Ong which is really delicious. The servings are not very generous. The prices appear cheap but don't be fooled for you get very little for what you pay. The staff are very nice and friendly, which is about the best I can say about this restaurant. All the following on this Thai restaurant  situated off the Strip did not live up to my expectations! Sorry.",0,0

There's also a bread vendor who sells amazingly delicious Rye for $4 a loaf -- if you miss out on this, you'll be bereft of some good sandwiches!  \n\nIf you're looking for where all the top chefs get quality niche ingredients, this is the spot.

The lady we coordinated with told us we would have a certain amount of tables in the upstairs loft.  With 50 guests, they sat up 4 tables.  It was a bit awkward with everyone standing.  The bar upstairs was fun though, all of our younger guests really enjoyed it.  I would recommend this for lunch or dinner, but do not throw a party here.",0,0

"Definite dive but the food was good.  They dont have carne Asada??!  That is weird to me...  Only green chile or red chile on the menu.  I was thinking- maybe they dont serve it becuase the meats too expensive- but then; there was tons of people in there so how can they NOT afford the meat when Filibertos has it??  Lots of cars in the parking lot and after we ordered it took like 20 minutes for our 1 BURRITO and 5 rolled taquitos/flautas... Im sorry- but that's way too long for simple taco truck orders.  The salsa cups are like the size of a THIMBLE so I had to like use a tray to carry over 7 thimbles of salsa to our table.  The restaurant is in a sketchy part of town and if it wasn't daytime with my stud of a BF, I would be concerned for my life and purse.  okay- back to the food.  The burrito was good.  The gauc is good.  It was all good but  the menu isn't something to RAVE about.  Im mexican so I could have made all the items on the menu by the time my ticket was called.",0,1
"Atmosphere - five stars.  Food - two stars.  Value - zero stars.\n\nFig Tree is in a beautiful old home, and I think it is the prettiest (and most romantic) restaurant I have been to in Charlotte.  Sadly, spending time in the house requires that you eat the food - and that's not something you really want to subject yourself to...\n\nThere are some positives to mention about Fig Tree.  I have been there for dinner on two separate occasions.  Each time, the service was good.  At the first meal, our server was particularly attentive and friendly.  A HUGE positive in Fig Tree's favor is that they do try very, very hard to provide great customer service.  Before my first visit I called the restaurant to ask about vegetarian options.  I spoke with someone from the kitchen, and he assured me that they could provide options that were not on the menu.  I was very impressed.  \n\nI have also been very impressed with the wine/champagne that I have had at Fig Tree.  At the first dinner, we had a half bottle of Lang and Reed Cab. Franc.  It is really hard to find, and it is an incredible treat when I get the chance to have it.  The second dinner I went to was a champagne dinner, and the champagne pairings were wonderful.  \n\nSadly, the food at Fig Tree has been a major disappointment.  At my first meal, I ordered a special which included a steak and a crab cake.  The steak was mediocre.  There was very little flavor, and the quality of the meat seemed totally inappropriate for the type of restaurant that Fig Tree aspires to be.  (To be fair, my vegetarian companion enjoyed her pasta dish.)  If the steak was mediocre, then the crab cake didn't get close to being mediocre.  It was one of the worst crab cakes I have ever had - at any restaurant.  I was shocked.  On my second visit to Fig Tree a friend was treating me to a champagne dinner.  I literally can't remember a single course... Not a good sign for such a memorable event.  \n\nI feel as though I have to try Fig Tree one more time, for so many people seem to love this restaurant... But, for now, I would recommend that you spend your money elsewhere if you are looking for a restaurant for a special evening.",0,0

We had the bacon green chili burger, pulled pork and the cowboy beans. It was all tasty and fairly priced. They had live music, plenty of alcohol and several fire pits to keep people warm. Unfortunately, I've heard through the grapevine that Greasewood Flat is closing soon :( It's too bad we waited this long to try it, because I'm sure it would be a place we'd visit often.",1,0
"I love Panera and moved to Phoenix from Pittsburgh, so gave Wildflower a try. Actually, two tries.\n\nThe first time, I was quoted a ten minute wait for my to go order. A combo with a half sandwich and salad. Twenty two minutes later my food came, with a profuse apology. And it had mushrooms on it even though I said I didn't want them.\n\n \n\nI figured maybe it was a fluke, so I tried again today. A To go order again, just a sandwich, nothing else, with no special requests. I wasn't quoted a time. Six people ordered To go orders after me. Six people. All six got their orders, and I am sitting there still waiting. I was the only one left waiting on the bench for four more minutes. And finally my order showed up. I didn't care at that point what the lady told me was in my bag, I just wanted out of there.\n\nI live a quarter mile away from there. I went straight home and opened my bag. My bread was completely soggy, which I guess I could forgive if the sandwich was hot, steam could do that. BUT....the meat was cold to the touch. How long did the staff just ignore my order and let it sit there. I almost called the manager. Almost. But I wasn't bothering to drive back there anyways, so just chocked it up to a loss.\n\n\nI don't know what's wrong with the Deer Valley location on Agua Fria in North Phoenix, but they seriously need to fix their To Go issues. I won't be returning to any Wildflower from now on. Panera's food is just as good, and the service is so much better than this location's. I will wait til I go back home.",0,0

"My inetntions were to spend alot of my Christmas money at Fry's.  I had 5 gift ideas for family members in mind looking to cross it off my list.\n\nMy first stop was the computer section where I asked a salesperson \""""What is your best deal on a monitor?\""""  First, he gave me the impression that he was in a rush and had no time to help.  After a few \""""ummms and uhhhhs\"""" he said \""""we have this monitor that cost $$$.\""""  He immediately started to walk away, so I quickly asked \""""Is there anything else cheaper perhaps on sale?\""""  He then had the damn nerve to tell me \""""You killin' me man, that's the best deal we have!\""""  I thought \""""What kind of F'd up response is that?\""""  I was so pissed off that I just told him \""""never mind\"""" and proceeded to walk away.  He changed his tone instantly and repeatedly tried to say I'm sorry, I was just playing.  BS!!!! His bad unprofessional service basically made myself as a customer feel like we were being cheap.  NOTE: I was prepared to spend $$$$ on several items.\n\nI then joined my wife in the camera section where she was looking for a camera and a specific battery charger.  I stepped back and watched her shop for it.  At one point she walked right passed 6 workers huddled in a circle who were lounging, laughing, and paying no attention to either my wife or her sister.  A supervisor then came out and even her didn't say \""""Can I help you with anything?\""""  I asked my wife to circle back around just to see if any worker would assist her, and AGAIN no one said a damn thing.  \n\nAll these seasonal hires that has no knowledge of what their selling and no customer service experience is what we encountered.  This lack of service was later re-enforced when I asked a question to a sales rep about a top of the line headphones.  His reply was \""""I don't know this is not my section, then walked away!\""""  He never bothered to say let me find someone who can help you or try to provide a answer.\n\nWe all left without spending a single a dime there, $$$$ lost in revenue for Fry's.  A very dissapointing visit to say the least.  My advice to corporate/management is to WAKE UP and equip yourselves.  Train your staff on the basics of customer service and don't hire all these seasonal reps with no experience because that only reflects bad on the company and its overall service. \n\nAt least the elderly lady at Wal-Mart where we went next did her best and genuinely tried to assist me.  She served us with a smile and didn't try to make up answers or run away from the transaction or questions.

"So I was in vegas for four days for a work conference. In the spirit of team building about ten of us decided to go to this restaurant. It was recommended by a friend of a friend's cousin...so we were a little skeptical. This place is in a shopping center away from a main road faced opposite from the road, so we were again a little sketched. As you walk in it looks like a normal restaurant, except I noticed a bunch of James Beard Awards on the wall...okay getting better. The menu was extensive. They had every thai food you could think of and then some more. Well instead of us searching, contemplating, arguing and then making up about the menu, we asked our server (that was the advice people kept givving us). \n\nSure enough, the server recommended item after item, and instead of getting just one thing per person we went family style and shared everything. It was a celebration of Thai food. The curried lamb and chicken were amazing. The noodles and tofu were just right. Everything was spot on and on point. I now see why they received all of those James Beard Awards. We also imbibed on some Thai Beer \""""Singha\"""", they have a large or a small...i would go for the large. They are good. \n\nNext time I am in Vegas I am definitly going here. The atmosphere is great, the servers are very helpful and they know the menu inside and out.

We were with a large party, so a hefty gratuity was already included despite the subpar service.  The Bloody Mary was below average, so I would skip the bottomless option. Overall, the brunch buffet was way overpriced for simple, average food quality and mediocre service. Two stars because it is 'good for large groups'.",0,1
"The choices at this airport are dismal at best. I chose the worst of the two evils. (Or so I thought) I ordered a Chipotle Panini. The cashier asked the person behind her if they had any and she said yes. I paid for my over priced sandwich and tea (they were out of bottled water!) A couple minutes later they called me back up to the front to tell me they were out, so I asked for a chicken walnut sandwich instead. They said they were out of that too. The cashier went to get the manager, who was very pregnant, and she didnt ask me if I wanted anything else, just opened the register and threw my money at me. She then barked at the cashier to tell people that they were out of all the paninis and chicken. I found the whole experience to be unprofessional and rude.

Chicken was cooking, and everyone was busy getting ready for the day...it was 10 am. \nSat down and waited for our order. Looking around we discovered that this place is poorly managed. The chair legs were filthy from where a mop had been up against them, there was crud of some kind...food probably...on the window sills, glass doors had hand prints all over them, and there was standing water with some warning signs around it. Little things really, but it all added up.\nThat being said, the tacos carbon and the salsa bar were really good. We had a side of tortilla chips that were stale. They were cold and stale. Blah.

Better decor, better beer choices, better quality food, and slightly better parking (only slightly, it still sucks at Parlor).  The cauiflower with aged cheddar cheese was quite tasty, but only came with 1 small piece of bread.  Pizzas were above average but not great - our crusts were burnt, and it felt like Sunday morning when I get to be the one who eats up the burnt pieces of toast.

I offered it carry out which I never do but I was in a rush. When I got there I gave the person up front the money and I noticed my food was completely wrong. The actual water from the soup was on the side instead of the chips so I told them and they kept arguing with me telling me I was wrong! I asked them for my money back and they said they would not give it to me since I ordered the food. I kept on asking for my money back and the manager herself told me I was \""""badly educated\"""". I told them fine and walked out with my change. Never got my food. Oh yeah and they charged me .50cents for a to go water. \nThe manager should never ever tell a paying customer that they are badly educated. I asked nicely for them to give me my money back and thy didn't. I paid $8.12 for them to criticize me. Ridiculous. I guess my Azteca days are over.",0,0

"WOW WOW WOW!!!  This little hole in the wall is amazing!!  My best friends when I was a child were Orthodox Greek straight from the islands and one of my best friends now is Greek and she and her Mother make AWESOME Greek food.   With all of that being said, I'm a major Greek food snob and I have unreasonably high standards, as a result.  I have been to dozens of Greek restaurants over the years and a handful from Charlotte, NC to Columbia, SC and, hands-down...Greco is far superior to any other that I have been to.  The freshness of the ingredients, the flavors and seasonings, and the quality of the meat is just like my Greek friends have made me accustomed to.\n\nI visited Greco for a late lunch.  Even at 2:00 on a weekday, there were several people in their enjoying their meals and more coming in as I was waiting.  The decor is unpretentious and captures the essence of Greece beautifully.  It has a bit of a Greek Diner feel, which I LOVE!  The service was fast and friendly and I enjoyed watching the chef  (owner, maybe??) prepare my food...\""""FRESH' is the key word in the title here.  I watched intently and everything was homemade (Tzatziki, Greek dressing, Lamb patties, etc).\n\nI ordered the Lamb Gyro combo with Lemon and Oregano Fries and a Peasant Salad.  The lamb patties for the Gyro are made onsite with fresh lamb and the most perfect Greek Lamb seasoning blend.  It's cooked on the grill-top to order (not made from greasy pre-fab mounds kept warm on a a spit).  This is real deal!!  The meat was moist, tender, and delicious!  It was served with housemade Tzatziki and tomato on a warm pita (I asked them to hold the onions).  The Tzatziki is made with yogurt, fresh shredded cucumbers, fresh herbs, and TONS of garlic....it's a flavor sensation!   The fries...OMG, the fries!!!  The most incredible seasoned fries I have ever tasted.  Tastes like traditional Greek Potatoes, but in french fry form (brilliant marketing move, BTW...everyone loves french fries!!).  French fries are fresh cut with skins, fried crispy on the outside and fluffy in the middle and then they are tossed in a bowl with salt, lemon juice, and oregano.  I will have dreams about these fries!  LOL   Last, but not least, is the Peasant Salad.  The Peasant Salad is everything that you love about a traditional Greek salad, minus the lettuce.  Giant wedges of plump red tomatoes, thinly sliced red onion, sliced seedless cucumbers (with the skin on), Kalamata Olives, and big cubes of deliciously salty and tangy feta cheese.  Again, all of the ingredients are put into a bowl and hand-tossed with Greek dressing and an extra dash of seasoning.  Salad is served with warm pita wedges.   It was a fantastic salad and the serving was huge!  Salads can also be topped with their house-marinated Chicken or Shrimp or their yummy Lamb.  They also have a Vegetarian Pita made with Red Peppers, Eggplant, and Zucchini and a kids menu.  They also offer Whole Wheat Pitas for a mere .25 charge.\n\nPrices are excellent as well.  I paid $15.00 (Gyro combo with Fries and a Drink and a full-sized Peasant Salad) and I made two meals out of it!  BTW, the Fries reheat perfectly in the oven!  \n\nIf you are looking for heavy Greek dishes such as Pasticio, Baked Fish, or Leg of Lamb, this isn't the place.  If you are looking for delicious Greek quick dishes, this is a must-try!\n\nI can't wait to go back with my husband....he is going to love it!!!   I must try the Spanikopita next time!\n\nI have a new favorite lunch place!!\n\nUpdate Oct 8, 2012: I have been back 3-4 times since my original review and the 5-star rating still stands!  The service is always excellent and the ingredients are always very fresh.  My Husband, Son, and Mother have also eaten here with me and they love it, too.  I truly can't say enough about the house-made Gyro meat...it is moist and perfectly seasoned every time!   We have also tried the Spanikopita and it is very good, too!  This is \""""the\"""" place for Gyros!",1,1
"Over the years I've taken guitars and amps to a lot of different shops and luthiers with mixed results.

"OK, I am just saying..If I am paying $40 for 2 nigiri I expect that when I sit down the hostess does not hit my knee with the table pushing it in before I sit down. I would also hope that the server would not forget our drinks, or new beers/cocktails every damn time we ordered them until the second or third time we ordered them again. It would have been nice to actually get our entire order before giving up and just asking for the bill instead of the missing item, again. Sigh, having to ask the server to remove the items on the bill we never received but had asked for several times was a bummer too.. I will NEVER go here again, unless I am not paying..",0,0
heard a lot of good things about this place unfortunately the closest to me is in las vegas. since i was in vegas i dropped by for a sandwich to go and decided on the capistrami. i thought it was a 8.5 out of 10. The bread was the best part of the sandwich. the pastrami was tasty but i've had better. that's not saying i wouldn't go here again because i absolutely will. good thing that i just found out there is one now in my city of torrance. i will be trying that one shortly...like as in tomorrow!,1,1

"In short: Awesomely nice inexpensive hotel with a shitty pool.\n\nIn long: We used priceline.com's name your own price, and got it for $60 on Thursday. In future if priceline won't hook it up, they offer a 10% off or so with AAA just fyi.\n\nWith a cheap hotel in mind I wasn't expecting much. And boy was I impressed (this is based on the checking in/out) and the rooms alone (aka I didn't really use the casino much but I did chill in one of the bars in the middle of the casino which was nice). \n\nThe room was SO SO nice. We got the Jim Carrey themed room so we had some paraphernalia from his movie in our room, so that set a pretty sweet mood. The beds were super big and super comfy. The room and bathroom were super spacey and super prestine, we felt like high rollers. There was also a 42inch or so flat screen tv with lots and lots of channels too, which was awesome. \n\nSo we went to the pool area and it SUCKED. It was this huggggggge area with terrible planning- the left and right most areas had decent sized, sort of boring pools (though the left one was closed) and then there was this HUGE area between the two just for tanning. I guess I understand a lot of people like to tan, but we all felt that it'd be much nicer if they flipped it and had a huge pool in the middle and tanning all around it. We were all pretty unimpressed. They played like top 40 on low volume in the background too. I guess I'd call it bland.\n\nBUT just in case someone really needs a pool or tanning area and you're staying at a shittier place or one without a pool or tanning area, they don't card you at all to get in and out.\n\nAll in all, a great, great experience- I'd definitely stay here from now on.",1,1
"I was here for a wedding reception, so perhaps this was not the \""""normal\"""" Quark's experience, but it was a lot of fun.  They served a choice of three entrees, Romulan Warbird, 24th Century Surf and Turf, and a vegetarian choice (pasta primavera).\n\nThe pasta was tasty, though could have had more garlic (I always want more garlic), and the surf and turf looked like a big juicy hunk of meat with some stuffed shrimp.  I didn't get a look at the chicken/warbird.\n\nThey had an open bar, including all the weird Trek-themed cocktails, so there were a lot of fishbowls filled with booze and dry ice wandering around.  The drinks were tasty, and entertaining on their own.\n\nThe room we were in for the reception was sort of Trek-themed like the downstairs, but not as over the top, unfortunately, but the occasional visits from a Ferengi and the appearance of a female Klingon warrior (who was apparently hunting the Ferengi) set the mood.\n\nDefinitely a good place to have a \""""Vegas\"""" wedding reception if you have geek friends, it was great.",1,1
"This restaurant had been on my radar ever since I got back to Madison for the summer, and I'm so glad I got to try it before I left! It was definitely refreshing to see such an authentic Chinese restaurant pop up downtown, and I'm sad that I won't be around to see how the business continues to grow.\n\nI ordered the BBQ pork (cha siu) rice bowl, which came with a side of boiled bok choy. It definitely satisfied a craving I'd had all summer for traditional Chinese cuisine!! Although the best part of the rice bowl was definitely the sauce that was drizzled over the BBQ pork and the rice, I enjoyed how everything went together.\n\nThey also have a variety of 'street food' style appetizer items, such as congee, BBQ pork/beef/chicken on a stick, and Chinese doughnut. \n\nHong Kong Station is definitely one of the better Chinese restaurants in the area, although I do believe that they could use a few big improvements: 1) complimentary hot tea, which is pretty commonplace at any decent Chinese restaurant; 2) servers/hostesses who can speak better english - way too much got lost in translation when we were ordering our meal, I was almost afraid that our orders were going to come out all wrong - this was particularly important to me because we had one vegetarian dining companion; 3) ix-nay on the gaudy decor - I get that they are going for a 'hole-in-the-wall'/'dive-y' type of appeal, but it just made the place look cramped. With these changes, it is easy to see HK station becoming a Madison favorite! :)",1,1
"Most people don't have a good time at this club. I could tell by the line-up of around 800 people on Halloween night. However, for my buddy (who looks just like Ryan Phillipe) and I, it was a seriously slick night.

The place is huge, offers ridiculous effects and lighting, and provides live entertainment from their excellent line-up of beautiful dancers (both male and female). The drinks here are over-priced, but that's something you have to live with. The place is legendary.\n\nSure, I didn't Mike Meyers there, but the place spanked of taste and the perfect club atmosphere. Even without cocaine, I felt like I was ripped anyways.\n\nStudio 54 is beautiful. It's exclusive. And the whole world wants to be in there.",1,0

"The two stars I gave are solely for the hotel, yes the hotel that's made of concrete and stone, I am giving the humans ( I don't even want to call them employees because obviously they all hate their job ) a big fat ZERO star.\n\nThe hotel is right behind Encore and Wynn, room is nice size and comfy. Its okay that theres no casinos inside. but there's NO soft music playing in the lobby neither. \n\nThe PROBLEM, though, is the attitude of the staff, the entire staff. I stayed twice for 8 days total, I believe I met them all. I stayed at Wynn, Bellagio, Mandarin Oriental and Aria before, their smiling, caring,  going-out-of-your-way service I was used to.

"FOOD: 4 stars\nAMBIENCE: 4 stars\nSERVICE: 5 stars\nVALUE for price (taking location into account): 4.5 stars\n\nWould give it 4.5 stars if I could, but I'm generous of heart and round up.\n\nWhat we had:\nBeef Brisket Taquitos: 4 stars (5 stars for plating)\nYucatan Pork: 4.5 stars (4 stars for plating)\nA Tecate and a Corona\n\nre: food - one of the nice things about Border Grill is that they clearly place an emphasis on consistency.  I've frequented their LA location, and noticed no difference in the style or quality of the food.  This shows great management.  Beef brisket taquitos were very good (but sauce was too mild for my spicy-loving tastes); Yucatan pork was the winner.  I also love that Border Grill doesn't overcook rice.\n\nre: ambience - typical Border Grill decor, but not their best location.  Patio overlooks the \""""Lazy River\"""" at Mandalay Bay - a slow-moving waterway filled with children and extremely fat adults floating along in inner tubes.  I cam to think of it as the \""""River of Pee,\"""" but I digress...)  It was pretty warm that day.  The gigantic fan outside is misleading; it doesn't seem to do anything to circulate air or cool the patio down.  Seems poorly designed.  It was also a little loud thanks to the packed pool.  But not awful.  Inside probably would've been the better choice, and we chose incorrectly.\n\nre: service - Border Grill Las Vegas delivered big on service with a fabulous plus host/waiter (we thought the charming man who seated us was the host, but we later saw him waiting on another section.)  Our waiter was also attentive without being over-bearing.  Never had to wait for anything or ask twice.\n\nre: price - cocktails looked to be about the same as LA prices.  Food had roughly a 20-25% Las Vegas premium over LA prices, but I suppose that's to be expected because 1) it's the Strip, and 2) they're probably trucking a lot of fresh ingredients into agriculturally-challenged Vegas.)",1,0
"I've been patronizing Mimi's for over 30 years and I am sad to report that they have finally reached their lowest point, at least at this location.  I have always been a BIG fan of Mimi's but this latest visit for a late breakfast on a Sunday morning was the most disappointing visit ever.  After almost a 20 minute wait we were finally seated even though the restaurant did not appear to be full.  The young girls who were taking names and seating customers didn't seem to know what they were doing.  Despite giving us one of those ridiculous vibrating devices with flashing red lights, they came outside at least twice looking for someone they could not find.  \n\nThe biggest disappointment was the cost of our breakfast dishes for what we received.  We each ordered a mimosa with a low end sparkling wine which cost almost $8 each.  My wife ordered their bacon apple waffles which were very good and tasty but there were only 3 tiny waffles about the diameter of a tennis ball . . . completely bare and accompanied by the tiny cup of syrup with chopped apples and bacon bits.  I have a French variation of eggs Benedict which was also pretty tasty but pricey for two small poached eggs on some seasoned mashed potatoes and spinach.\n\nOur server was efficient but somewhat intense and not very personable.  Even the carpet in the dining area appeared dirty and unkempt.  Just not a great experience.  Probably won't return to ANY Mimi's for some time because they have definitely lost their edge and reputation as an upscale value chain restaurant.\n\nAlthough I am a budding senior citizen (my wife is NOT) I'm beginning to feel out of place at Mimi's which is often populated by a sea of white hairs and snow birds who don't seem to mind their mediocre, high priced fare set in a sort of Disneyesque French atmosphere.  It just doesn't resonate with me anymore and it doesn't feel at all upscale middle of the road like it used when they first opened restaurants in So Cal where I used to live.",0,0

"There are many Hawaiian restaurants in Vegas, and it's a competitive cuisine to be in.  Island Flavor has every right to be confident that they will be sticking around.\n\nThe Husband first mentioned this place after he saw the sign go up replacing Pho 777.

He remembers it being really good and was telling me all about it.\n\nThe first time I went was to grab a spam musubi to go.  It was pretty busy and I was intrigued.  (The spam musubi was good too.)\n\nThe next time the Husband stopped by for a to go order and brought home the special that had chicken in it.  I remember trying some and thought it was good, although we weren't too happy about the mac salad.  Also brought home a spam musubi too.\n\nWhen I finally had a chance to have a sit down meal there, I ordered the combo ($9.75) of Kalbi Short Ribs \""""Tender short ribs marinated in our Korean sauce & broiled to perfection\"""" and the Furikake Shrimp \""""Jumbo shrimp coated with panko and furikake fried golden brown and served with oriental sauce.\""""  It came with two scoops of rice and mac salad.  What an order it was!  Generous portions of three slabs of short ribs and so yummy!  The three shrimps were also a good size and had a nice crust because of the panko.  I was pleased.  It was definitely a lot, and you will need a box for leftovers.  The mac salad tasted a lot better this time around too.\n\nThe  Husband got the combo of Kalbi Short Ribs and Hawaiian Style Roast Pork \""""Served open face topped with our homemade gravy\"""" and it was a large size order too.  Also served with two scoops of rice and mac salad.  They definitely make sure you don't go hungry here.  He ate up the whole thing himself, and left with a full belly.\n\nAs we were leaving, the Husband mentioned it would just be awesome if they offered dessert.  I told him they did, I saw it on the menu!  I think the next time around he may just save a bit of room for a sweet finish.  I wish they offered my favorite - Pork Lau Lau!\n\nOverall, food is good and generous.  Service comes with a smile and you definitely feel at home here.  They get a lot of business, whether it's the weekend or a week night.  The owner told us they have two restaurants already on the Big Island, so they know what makes a restaurant successful here.  When you're dining in, you feel like everyone knows each other already.  It's a nice feeling.\n\nThey have coupons available on entertainmentbook.com, which we used.  The owner also mentioned they have coupons available on restaurant.com too so we should look into that as well.

Tim (Mgr) and the rest of the staff are always friendly. Nice selection of baked goods and soup (during the winter months). Coffee is always good. But the building it's housed in is falling apart. Numerous water leaks inside from a shoddy roof. They even have a sign on the wall next to one of the tables warning you of a leak. The carpeting is in desperate need of cleaning and the furniture is filthy and thread bare. This has been my go-to place for coffee since 2012 but that's going to stop. Just can't stomach the conditions inside this coffee house any longer. Hopefully the building owner will get motivated and fix the leaks and they do a thorough cleaning of the place.,0,0

Maybe I should try that next time.  The taco was also really good, but also small for $3.  All sides, including chips and salsa, are going to cost you extra.\n\nMy taste buds were certainly satisfied.  The food's quality is superior to any of the upscale fast food burrito chains (it may even be better than many full service restaurants), but you'll get a lot more for your money at those other places.  Your options for everything is steak, pork, or veggie.  I probably should have asked this while I was there;  But what does America's Taco Shop have against chicken?\n\nThe restaurant is small.  It does feel a lot like a little cantina somewhere in Mexico. There's very little room inside.  The patio seems like an okay spot, but I wouldn't want to be inside or out on a hot summer day.  The parking situation is really bad.  The lot is tiny.  Your best bet is to skip the lot and just find room on the neighborhood streets.",1,1
"My wife and I went to Las Vegas for a long weekend trip.  We gambled, we saw some shows, and ate great food.  The thing we enjoyed the most was our time at Exotics Racing.  We each took 7 laps in the Ferrari F430.  As others have indicated, the instructors help you go fast. At one point, when being told to accelerate, my instructor told me \""""all the way to the floor\""""!  How cool is that?  We will definitely be going back our next time in Vegas!!",1,1
"I went here yesterday for the first time looking for a specific product that only they carry in the Madison area.  It's definitely a fun little shop to look around in.  They have just about anything and everything you could be looking for naturopathic.   Basically I was like a gigantic child sneaking around touching and smelling everything.  They probably didn't appreciate that.  However,  I didn't break stuff and run up and down the aisles screeching.",1,1
"This is one of those locations that I have walked past the last two years and never got around to trying.  My main attraction to the storefront is the plastic food out front, which just looks so wonderfully Japanese to me.  There is something about shiny plastic food replicas that really peaks my interest.  Also, the amount of corn used on the food also made me think that it was a Japanese franchise.  It is in fact not, but Canadian, and Montreal specific.  The only other two location are at the Six Flags Theme Parks in the province.  \n\nThis is a small cafe with only one worker that does everything, or at least at the times that I visited.  You order at the counter and pay, and then they will call out your order for pick-up.  Seating is limited to about three tables, with an excellent view of the street.  \n\nThey are sold out of many items, like chicken salad and waffles.  However, I ordered the Tuna Salad Crepe and it tasted much better than expected.  The crepe was slightly sweet and crunchy, filled with tuna salad sandwich toppings; tomato, lettuce, corn, sliced processed cheese, and tuna salad.  All of the items here are cheap, keeping most under $5.50 CAD.  \n\nAlso, we ordered a Nutella covered plain crepe, it was perfect.  These are not knife and fork style crepes, instead the hand held version.  Most of the toppings are made in house.  I watched the cook slicing the fresh strawberries before assembling them for the previous customer.  Next time, I will get that chicken salad with curry topping.",1,1

"Thanks to Asian Sweet Bakery, I no longer need Chicago to get my fix of coconut rolls, BBQ pork bun, custard tarts, or red bean sesame balls. Dare I say it, do I even need donuts anymore? Moreover, their breakfast special and value pricing make me feel good about coming back often. \n\nI basically ordered everything I wanted to try during my first trip here, things I've been missing and craving, like steamed rice crepe with shrimp, rice porridge with fish and preserved egg. The beef and vermicelli noodle soup was good too, just a tad too much gristle. My hope is that they will expand or refresh the menu as business booms. Space is extremely limited, and it felt crowded by the cash register. We had to hover for a table during the Saturday lunch rush, but it's hard to complain when you see a family-owned business selling the stuff you like, doing well. \n\nService was business-like but pleasant. I was pleased to see a variety of customers from older to younger folks, international students to transplanted locals, blue and white collar workers, with quick turnaround all around. I'm hoping this popularity will translate into a larger space in the future, but it may still be early yet.",1,1

"I hate this Wal Mart. It's so ghetto. You can tell when people get their government assistance because you are more prone to see carts FULL of groceries at that time. Not that it is a problem who receives what, but the environment of this Wal Mart sucks. I live the closest to this Wal Mart though so I must deal. Most of the time I go to Target but there are times where I used to come here. EVERY TIME I used to come someone asked me in the parking lot if I wanted to buy tamales. Like EVERY TIME! It annoyed the shit out of me because I would usually be coming out with my items. So obviously I wouldn't want your tamales when I am sure if I wanted some I could get them from a restaurant or maybe even from inside. Another thing is people standing at the front one particular guy says he is an \""""aspiring\"""" artist and when I ignored him as I was walking out he played the race card saying we are both African American and we should support each other. Wal Mart shouldn't allow people to be soliciting outside the store UNLESS they are selling girl scout cookies.\n\nI did love to get my watermelon from here though it's cheap huge and super sweet! \n\nAll Wal Marts are not created equal...

"Let me preface this Yelp Review with this point: I can appreciate the low prices that Wal-Mart provides, but I generally think Wal-Mart as a corporation is the scum of the Earth.  This Wal-mart specifically is super ghetto, people take their small children shopping at 11:00 at night, and the employees are extremely unprofessional.  Case in point: my girlfriend stopped at this Wal-mart the other night to get a few things because this location is very close to my house.  Upon entering the store we realized that we would need a cart.  I circled back to where the carts are usually kept to grab one but there were none to be found.  I noticed that Wal_mart had two \""""greeters\"""" at the door not doing anything.  I asked one of the greeters if they had any carts available, and she responded that all the carts were in the parking lot and if I wanted one I should go out in the parking lot and get one. I said \""""Seriously? You don't have any carts for your customers?\""""  She reiterated that I would have to go out to the parking lot and find a cart.   I always assumed that the greeters role (besides putting those little stickers on returns) was to provide customers with a cart.   \n\nWal-mart - since when is it the customer's job to collect carts for you?  You are the wealthiest corporation in the world, I'm sure you can pay someone minimum wage to collect your carts.  If you want customers to shop and return, maybe you will learn the concept of customer service.",0,0

"There was four of us who went here today for a late lunch.  My wife Carol, our friend Kathy R. and a close friend of mine from Oaklahoma Cliff Y and of course me.\n\nI don't even know where to begin about this restaurant, right from the get go I knew there was going to be problems. We started off with  appetizers. When the dolmades was served it was slightly warm to the touch. The Flaming Saganaki (slice of cheese set on fire) was excellent in addition to being an impressive presentation it was darn cool.\n \nSo our food comes out, this is where things turned bad...here is what we all got:\nOur friend Kathy R. -  Mousaka - When it was served the Saut\u00e9ed veggies were somewhat warm but more on the cold side. The Mousaka was frozen in the middle. She asked for it to be reheated. Her soup was not hot so she also sent that back to be reheated. Of course when the Mousaka and soup returned both were very hot.  BUT when Kathy tasted her dish she said this is so bad it it was inedible and didn't eat the Mousaka. I thing she had her soup.\n\nMy friend Cliff Y. said he enjoyed his Gyro plate and told me everything was fine. But that was probably because he was extremely hungry before his food arrived or he was just being polite.\n\nMy wife, Carol had  a a combo pork and chicken kebab. It came out , marginally  warm this included the roasted potatoes, veggies and meat so she sent it all back to be reheated. When her dish returned she ate it and enjoyed her food.\n\nMy dish - I ordered a combination plate which consisted of a Beef & veggie kebab. I started off my meal with a side salad, it was good but a salad is a  salad. The Beef and veggie kebab like everyine elses that was served during our visit was barely this included the roasted potaotes, meat and veggies. I was so disappoinyed I simply pushed my meal aside and did not eat it. There is nothing more discusting as food served lukewarm. Ontop of everything else my beef kebob was over cooked and dry. Yick! When asked if I wanted something else I said no just take it away. \n\nWith all the food that was sent back and our comments / complaints during dinner to our waitress the manager never came out to speak to us. Instead another waitress compt'd us a couple of deserrts and gave me two $10.00 gift certificates (good for one gift certificate per table per visit) for on our next vist. This is one a $96.00 bill. I was curious about the restaurant so I asked \"""" Is everything made in advance and just reheated here\"""". She told me all the food is prepaired fresh and cooked daily. I seriously doubt it.\n\nFOOD: Honestly, none of the dishes really stood out to me. A real disappointment. The presentation of the food on our plates was impressive but that is where it stopped. PRICE: reasonable price. SERVICE: Our waitress Mercedes was polite, attentive and courteous.  AMBIENCE: The restaurant is pretty and has a lovely atmosphere  CONCLUSION:  I left so upset, disappointed and unsatisfied. I wasn't a bit Impressed.

I came here for a weekend event with a big group of friends.  I've never stayed downtown so I was a bit skeptical at first.

The pool is really nice but they definitely need to add a jacuzzi.  It never even occurred to me that a Las Vegas casino wouldn't have one.  Come on guys...you spent all the money remodeling and didn't put in a jacuzzi! \n\nThe casino was nice and clean.  But my luck wasn't any better here than at any of the casinos on the strip.

It has a great variety of classes to choose from,  wow so many that sometimes I debate which I want to take.

Was visiting friends over a weekend and was very hungry by the time we reached the restuarant. They kept us waiting for 40 minutes and the hostess dint care that we were waiting she just doing her own thing.\n\nFood good but not the best Thai food that I ate.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this place if you want to grab something quick.,0,1
"Fantastic food, fantastic staff, and fantastic decor.\n\nI was really surprised when we walked in and there was no one there but us the whole time, but...we were there around 3:30 for a late lunch/early dinner, and they were setting up for two big parties. \n\nWe sat down and took in the very cozy decor, all antiques which I am in love with. Our waiter was great, as well as another employee who came by and apologized for the noise (which none of really noticed) as they were setting up tables for the parties that were coming in later on in the evening.\n\nTwo of us started off with a Samuel Smith Organic Cider, and Hummus with warm Pita bread, which was great. I ended up getting the Penne Gorgonzola...what sold me on my choice? In the description it said...'Blue Cheese lovers unit' Hands down possibly the best pasta I've gotten from a restaurant ever. Tasted very authentic, and very fresh. \n\nWe ended our meal by splitting the Pumpkin Cheesecake...to die for, really. \n\nEverything I ate here, and experience at Bunky's is all hands down great. Can't wait to stop in again.",1,1
"Not a big buffet eater, however was at the Fiesta casino and was hungry.  Buffet is on the 2nd floor of the casino, not elaborate, but not pricey.  With casino card buffet is about $6, I do not know where you can get juice, coffee, a full meal and desert for that price,\nI had turkey with a pineapple sauce, which I thought was quite tasty; also bbq chicken on a roasting spit on the day I was there. Ample selection of salads and dressings, pizza which I had a slice, not bad at all.  There was a ample selection of deserts, pies, cookies, pastries and off to the side soft serve ice cream.\n\nYou can stop at the cheesecake factory and get a cup of coffee for 1/2 the price. \nYou decide.",1,1
"Yummmmm-hum. This review is for drinks and dessert. Which should be enough for you to get an idea because it was for me!\n\nDish is fannnnncy but I think the service, food, ambiance, furniture, etc. are all in accordance with the price. \n\nThe bar is copper. Probably not to the core but it's copper colored or plated! Pretty and shiny! I had a ginger old fashioned. Highly recommended over their sazerac which was just okay. \n\nThe chocolate bread pudding was really really good. Hot but not dry, spongy but not gummy, and topped with chocolate sauce and fresh, delicious blueberries. Eating blueberries in February is cheating but if no one hears about it then it's ok. They were like tangy gifts from Mexico. The fruit kind. \n\nNext we asked for espresso Martinis but I kind of wanted just an espresso and maybe another drink. Next time I won't have a coffee martini. I feel like my brain was confused by the chemical combination, like, I'm tired! Noooo I'm up! Nooo I'm wired! When all I ever really was was full. \n\nThe dinner menu looked great too. Many options for all diners. Maybe will try again on a visit to Pittsburgh. It will have to wait some time but the place comes highly recommended so it won't be forgotten.",1,1
"I love salad bars. Love. LOVE. \n\nBut I can't eat here. And by that I don't mean that it isn't veg-friendly - it most def is - I mean that the quality of ingredients, salad, toppings, potato bar, made-from-powder soups are so low that I get scared. Fear is an appetite inhibitor. \n\nI've hit this trough three times, and had gurgley tummy after each and every one. The ladies that work here are totally great - even acknowledge and remove and replace, say, the cukes, when I express concerns about their harboring of evil bacteriums and such (WOW they smelled weird last time I was here). But any effort on my part to save my and others' bellies from grossville feels like polishing the brass on the Titanic. \n\nSo I continue to harass Sweet Tomatoes via email, monthly, with the hopes that one day we'll actually have a decent Bar in Charlotte.

"It seems difficult to find a coffee shops in Tempe south of the 60. At least two have closed their doors since I've lived in Tempe during the last 5 years.\n\nSolo has filled a much-needed niche.\n\nThey have good coffee. Really good coffee. So good that the owner/barista actually asked me how the coffee was before I left. Imagine that! A barista that cares about his pour.\n\nThe internet is free and fast (the latter might be because it is still pretty unknown... I haven't been in there and seen more than two other customers) and there are plenty of places to plug-in.\n\nThe place has a comfortable feel to it... an eclectic mix of ikea bookshelves, modern photography, vintage records and lamps, and antique furniture pieces.\n\nOne somewhat odd thing: liquid sugar. Out of a little dispenser. I ended up drizzling it down the side of my mug. Maybe its more eco-friendly than sugar packets? I dunno.\n\nMy only gripe: as of early April 2008, they are only open until 9pm, making it an unreasonable destination for a late night of studying or socializing. They say this is going to change.\n\nThey seem to be rolling things out slowly. They do accept credit cards (though a previous review indicated that they don't).",1,1

"On the search for the best frozen treat in the Las Vegas Valley my boyfriend and I stopped here because of all the positive reviews and the cool old school vibe. I am glad I thumbed through a couple reviews and learned of the cash only exception. This custard stand is sandwiched between a 7/11 and the olympic gardens in the heart of the Naked City. I am glad we came in the daylight hours if you know what I mean. \n\nThe frozen custard itself was very tasty. I enjoyed the limited selection of flavors of the day, often being indecisive myself. My boyfriend went with a junior sized cup of the malt custard and I had a junior cup of the western with vanilla. I would have love to order an more exciting order but the lady behind the counter didn't give me much of a chance to speak up. Seeming overly excited to close the window blocking out the already 90+ degree temperatures. \n\nOverall fun experience but not as delicious as Lappert's Ice Cream inside the California Hotel and Casino",1,1
"Love the atmosphere of this place, but the service SUCKS. Just when we thought it couldn't get any worse. We come here every Monday to listen to our friends play acoustic during happy hour. Up until this past Monday (5/19/14), we could put up with the horrible service, but when there are only four tables seated and you have to wait for over 10 minutes to put in your first drink order, should've been a sign of things to come. We could see the waitress peeking around the pillar at us and then go back to her conversation with her coworkers. The waitress was fairly new because I remember meeting her last week, but they are all the same. Our food order was taken just after our drinks were delivered and still had not arrived after 45 minutes ( it never takes that long). She informed us that it would be right out but still never came. After sitting there with empty glasses for 20 minutes we decided to close our tab. We were there a total of 90 minutes. We will never be coming back to this place again.",0,0
"If this concept was in a big city it would be a hit but this is Old Town.  We got there around midnight on a Friday and called the # and was told it would be 15-20 min and we should wait at the bottom of the stairs.  I don't mind waiting but the bottom of the stairs is right next to the smelly dumpster that has been sitting in the 110 degree sun all day.\n\nMy friend got tired of the smell and moved up to the top landing only to be chased back down by the hostess when she went to let out another group of people.\nAfter 20 min we finally get called and head upstairs.  The cocktail list is AMAZING but be prepared to wait, our first round of 3 drinks took 15 min to get.  The place wasn't busy at all.  It seats 30 but there were maybe 12 people there.  They also have a separate late night menu than the one listed on the drink menu so we had to wait for the new menu before we could rethink our order.\n\nI know it was their late night menu but it left a lot to be desired and if you don't like pork there is like 1 option for you in the hummus plate.  I got the porkbelly bahn Mi which was mediocre.  No flavor from the pork at all and the pickled vegetables overwhelmed the entire sandwich.\n\nThe speak easy concept is interesting but I don't know how it would ever work at this location  Guys aren't allowed to approach girls but are encouraged to send drinks to a lady they may be interested in.  With only 30 people in the room, that doesn't leave a lot of room for interaction with strangers.  Also would have been nice to be informed of the 20% service charge automatically added to all drinks.  Auto Grat makes for lazy servers.",0,1
"I'm so sad because I really like this bar  they have cool yummy drinks and its just easy and relaxed. But The service here was annoyingly slow.

Finally makes eye contact with me \""""oh u ready?\"""" No shit Sherlock. Finally got our second round, again the drinks r Delish but by this time I was too annoyed to enjoy it. Then she finally sees were done again, we ask for our bill and wait another 10-15 mins. I'm pissed now so I got up and asked her about it, Apparently it takes the bartender 20 mins to discount a bill with a coupon the hotel gave me!! wtf?!

First, we had to practically beg them to take a reservation for ten, which they sort of honored. At least there were a few free tables they were able to push together when we arrived.\n\nOur waitress was the only shining star - she did a good job of taking care of 9 people with 7 separate checks and she kept the drinks refilled. She was also helpful in getting a couple of the TV's switched over to the Panthers game (they lost).\n\nWe had a few appetizers for the table. The pretzel \""""bones\"""" were good, served with a couple of different sauces, as were the onion rings with their dipping sauces. If you like cheese fries, try the Fire Stix which were the best part of the meal.\n\nHaving read the reviews, I knew to stay away from the brisket. I went with a \""""lunch\"""" sized portion of sliced smoked turkey breast. It was dry and not much more than warm. After we asked, the waitress brought out the bbq sauces, which improved the bland taste. The \""""fire roasted corn\"""" was good - a corn and red pepper medley that was tasty. The mashed potatoes with gravy were good as well, especially when I mixed it with the corn. ;-) Both sides were too small and my friend sitting next to me got an even smaller undersized scoop of potatoes with his salmon.\n\nWe didn't have dessert. They added 18% gratuity to the check, which was understandable for the size of our group.\n\nWould I go back? No, I don't think so.",0,1

I wouldn't be exaggerating if I told you that the chips were the best thing we ate.. Everything we ordered seriously had no taste at all! Everything. It was so disappointing to eat food that looked good but really had no flavor whatsoever.. And it was every dish... So either the chef doesn't try what he's serving, or they don't actually care what the food tastes like because after all this is a bar, and we should be thankful that they serve something to eat in the first place...\n\nOn the drinking end, they had a large menu, but we stuck with a few bottles of wine so can't really comment on the drinks..

"My wife and I are both Priority Club Rewards members, and we need to tell you of the most unusual and frustrating  and unprofessional experience we just went through at The Desert Club Resort Las Vegas.\n\nWe stayed there through an offer / invitation from HI Club Vacations to look at their timeshare resort on arrival date of October 14, 2012. To sum things up quickly, WE WERE NOT IMPRESSED !  In fact, we were impressed in a negative way. Let me explain below.\n\nIt all started a few months before we arrived; we were INUNDATED with 10 + phone calls and emails to remind us of the penalty of a no show; and constant phone rhetoric from HI about \""""you must keep this appointment\"""" or we will charge you $150 per night times 7 nights. Enough already ! I had to request that they put me on a \""""no call list\"""".  This finally stopped the calls.\n\nUpon arrival, we were again badgered with negative hostility about damaging the room and that we would be charged for damages.We were told that a $250 hold would be put on our credit card, just in case. \n\nSome other negative issues we had with the room and the policies are :\n\n1. No shower cap available for my wife\n2. I asked at check in for help with luggage ( we were on the second floor)   --  still waiting.\n3. There should be paper and pencil by the phone in the rooms.\n4. Charge for ALL out going calls, including 800 numbers.  --  very tacky.\n5. Only one tea and one coffee set up for the full stay  - we were told to buy your own.  This is not good for HI to promote this as a RESORT. It is more like a \n    upgraded apartment complex.\n6. Only one usable mirror in the entire unit.\n7. The room is so small that you can not open the refrigerator without moving the dinning room table / chairs.  The bathroom was so small that it could only \n     accommodate one adult at a time.\n8. No towel bars in bathroom.\n9. The tub / shower was not good for older adults as it was very difficult to step over and into the tub. There was no grab bar IN THE TUB.   The shower head was \n     poor as it had no pressure.\n\nNow for the worst:  \n\n\n.The final insult was that when we departed, they required us to strip the bed, put all linens and towels in the tub, take out the garbage,and sweep all the floors. \n    By the time my wife and I accomplished all of this, we needed a shower and a fresh change of clothes.I do not believe that  any hotel management, would expect the guests to exit the unit with this approach.

"Four Seasons Vegas is still the true boutique hotel on the Strip.  There are now a handful of new hotels on the Strip for people who do not appreciate having a casino on the premises.  It started with the ultra modern, The Hotel, and spread to a number of properties in the City Center.  Nevertheless, neither the Mandarin Oriental nor the Encore offer the privacy and that true small hotel feel that the Four Seasons offers.  You will not get people that do not belong walking around the lobby.  Now that it has been remodeled, this Four Seasons is a true oasis for those desiring privacy while visiting Vegas.

Well it was decent, not too strong but not weak I suppose. Then after having been whining earlier about how I couldn't do shots, I did one of Absolute LA. I had wanted to try it since I love Acia. But I usually hate flavored vodka, even blueberry, so it could have been awful. But it wasn't, especially since the bartender shook it in ice before hand.\n\nOverall, we got drunk and they didn't charge us an arm or a leg! A great save, thank you mobile Yelp.",1,0

"My husband and I went to TK's because we were going to Sephora's, saw the menu online, and it looked good.  We were greeted nicely by the hostess and seated right away.  Our server didn't introduce himself, just appeared.  The first dish we ordered was the mac&cheese starter.  It was so salty!  We told the server it was too salty, and he just shrugged and left.  My husband ordered the pulled pork, and I ordered the short rib sandwich.  Both were supposed to have horseradish sauce.  We couldn't taste it, thought it wasn't on the sandwiches, and ordered the sauce separately.  Still couldn't taste the horseradish!  The fries were limp and the ketchup that came with them tasted very strange.  Mostly, the food was tasteless and the server had no interest in whether we were enjoying ourselves or needed anything.  I will never go back!",0,1
"Thai Style Noodle House has always caught my eye since regular at Liu same shopping mall. Thai food is definitely one of my favorites. So was excited about coming in for lunch and trying some of the food.\n\nI ordered the Chicken and Shrimps Silver Noodles. I was in the mood for a nice hearty noodle dish for lunch. This dish delivered on point!!! They were not skimpy on the protein either chicken or shrimp, nice amount of vegetables from bean sprouts, carrots, cabbage, and the clear noodles again nice portion size. I really liked the sauce not really heavy gravy sauce but more light sauce. Not over powering. All the vegetables had nice crunch, al dente, and looked eye appealing just looking at it. It reasonable price. Menu is pretty diverse with lots of pictures just in case not sure.\n\nThe service was excellent. I got seated soon as I walked in. Never had empty glass. The decor is pretty interesting. It had bland look too it. Sure the walls are painted so nothing like cafeteria style. On one side of the walls there couple widescreen televisions. Other then that and one sculpture that sit on the counter. Odd. Yet they have modern look between the light fixtures above and the seats. If you walk in never think going into Thai restaurant. Good or bad? It all about the food for me. In Thai Style Noodle House case am FAN. No doubt plan on making it regular lunch spot for me and trying more of the menu.",1,1
"\""""Where are the prices\"""" my wife asked me when we started looking at the appetizers on the menu. We called our server over and she explained the numbers after the description were the prices, they just didn't include the \""""$\"""" symbol. Weird, since the entree prices were clearly marked.  \n\nWe started with the summer rolls expecting something similar to spring rolls we have had at many Thai restaurants.  These were very different due to the tortilla like wrapper that was fried crisp on the outside but was tough on the inside. The filling was mediocre and could have used some ginger or basil or any flavoring ingredient. $6 for six small summer rolls is overpriced in my opinion and I would not order them again.\n\nSpicy green beans with pork was my lunch selection and when it arrived I was stunned to see a 1/4\"""" thick orange slice as garnish - something I would expect at the Sun City Denny's - but not on a gorgeous plate of peppers, green beans and pork slices. I dug in and found the food temperature barely lukewarm. My entree was nicely flavored with a fairly mild curry sauce and since this was our first meal at Tom Yum I had ordered medium hot and it was spot on for peppery heat. The sliced pork was on the tough side probably due to being cooked at too low a wok temperature thus sweating instead of frying.\n\nMy wife tried the cashew pork and her entree arrived (with orange slice) piping hot, the pork was tender and the onion chunks perfectly cooked.  The sauce was very tasty and the pepper level was just right - medium.\n\nEntree portion sizes were not overly generous but the rice portions were downright tiny: one small soup bowl of rice per entree. I almost chose brown rice for an additional $1 but was very glad I didn't when I saw the skimpy little rice serving.",0,0

"This hole-in-the-wall location is perfectly lovely. Believe the hype, people. My Texan friend complained that their tacos weren't spicy enough, but I'm sure you can let them know to up the spice level for you. I love that they make their own corn tortillas (which are gluten-free, friends). They also fry or grill any meat of your choosing. I met the owner once to interview him for Best of CU for Buzz, and he was the sweetest guy from Mexico City. He recommends the authentic fish tacos. I love their pumpkin flower and corn fungus quesadillas and their chicken volcanes, but all their menu items are perfectly delicious. All orders come with a side of chips with two types of lip-smacking salsa.\n\nRather long wait sometimes, but just go at odd hours or endure the wait. They have an array of authentic Mexican sodas waiting inside as well. Seating is rather fickle and sparse, so get ready to carry out unless you're eating plus one. Enjoy!",1,1
"So I'm not usually one to fuss, pretty laid back so if something bothered me then well....bravo. This mcdonalds isn't in the greatest area, I can't fault the employees for that.

Like tonight, customer causing a minor disturbance and was rude, and the girl which appeared to be a manager of some sort was behind the counter and got upset (naturally of course) she went and handled the customer. Waited for him to come out of the bathroom just waiting there while customers including myself were in line. Ok I get it, go handle the customer, go on with your bad self and handle the shituation. Yes I said shit-u-ation. I get it, go handle the stupid idiot. But when there's a line of customers waiting for service you would think you would get someone to cover you instead us waiting 5 minutes or ATLEAST a simple apology saying \""""I'm sorry I'll be right with you\"""" instead she was cursing and mumbling under her breath.

"Oh Yelp, how could you have steered me so wrong?  After taking the kiddies ziplining on Fremont, I met up with an old friend who was looking for something to eat. Rather than go straight home as I had previously decided, I whipped out the trusty Iphone and Yelped restaurants near me. \n\nWe ended up at Du-Par's and after looking around and ignoring my spidey senses, we waited for a table. As we made our way to the back of the restaurant, I scanned other patrons plates and came to a startling revelation. All the tables were full but 95% of them had no food on the tables...and no forks. The waiters were gathered near the kitchen talking about how they are out of forks. \n\nWe get to our table and peel open our menus. My friend checks in on foursquare and gets the greasy spoon badge. My fears grow. Jack, a really nice guy/waiter comes over and takes our order. A long while later, he brings our food...or our grease with a little food sprinkled under it. My pancakes were drenched in grease (or fake butter) I took a napkin and soaked it up and the napkin ended up weighing more than my two year old. \n\nThe kids (who apparently have no taste buds) were happy with their burger and omelette. My friend was too busy taking photos of her grease laden salad dressing to comment...until my son excitedly pointed out an unidentified bug crawling on the booth across from us. We sternly warned him not to identify the bug so as to spare our vomit reflexes and we made a swift exit. I continued to weigh the pros and cons of vomiting for an hour afterwards and my son continued to ask if I was interested in knowing the etymology of the bug that I was trying so desperately to forget.\n\nSuffice it to say, I wanted to cry over my wasted $54 and the food/experience tasted like regret.",0,0

"We dined in for lunch one day, the floor had been mopped with a dirty/sour mophead, you can smell the funky odor on the floor. Teri beef is fatty/greasy and tough. Mahi Mahi is just chunks of cooked fish. Huge slathering of stucky white rice and overly mayoed mac salad with no flavor. My chicken katsu came with what I still think is ketchup and no katsu sauce. I asked for katsu sauce and the boss lady says that is katsu. No it's Ketchup, not tonkatsu sauce like everyone knows. So I asked for a side of teri sauce instead. My chicken katsu is Deeeep fried extra hard and the chicken had tough skin underneath. Too crunchy and taste like low grade chicken, greasy. Overly mayoed mac salad and a huge wave of white rice that wasn't all that fresh. Is this good food? I guess some think so and they are welcome to it.

Beware of the 2 drink minimum, I understand a 2 item minimum but when I said I will be ordering a couple of food items I was informed I still had to order 2 drinks on top of  the food I was going to have.

"We have been here for lunch and dinner recently, each time hoping we have found a 'keeper' on our Restaurant List, sadly at this point that is not the case.\nMost recently we dined there Friday night, the restaurant was quite busy, something  the staff was unprepared to handle.  A sudden influx of customers can understandably slow down service; however when we made our reservation we took the last remaining spot available for that hour.  They should have prepared accordingly.  Our biggest disappointment came from the wait staff.  Service was exceedingly slow, discombobulated, cumbersome at best.  Our table was wobbly, a request for the wine list took at least 15 minutes, then we had to ask again.  We were served our plates from the wrong side, the waiter reaching across the table to serve, they did not get one course served to the correct person.  It appeared as if it were a new restaurant  opening, unprepared and understaffed.  On the service side, one of their saving graces may be the recent addition of some of the staff from the recently closed Rosemary's, where service was always impeccable. \n\nAdditionally, the choice of music that was piped in the background, was not dinner appropriate unless you are under 30 years old. \n\nGarfields certainly is a lovely restaurant, nautical theme with a fabulous location.  Sadly, we have not experienced eating anything particularly  memorable there, with the exception of the bread.  Plus, we found the menu sorely lacking in variety, nothing jumps out at you, it's all pretty ordinary fare.    \n\nWith Marche Bacchus, one of the best 'off the Strip' restaurants literally a few steps away, Garfields has formidable competition.

Like I said the garlic chicken was also reallly good too, and the mussels were great and only 5.50 for a decent sized portion, next time I go I think I will try more of the tapas than just getting sushi. \n\nOnly complaint is that they need to get a couple TVs on the walls so you can come here to watch a game, etc. Definitely would help the atmosphere IMO",1,1

"My wife and I were super excited to try this after seeing it on Man vs. Food so we made it a priority to eat lunch there.  We were seated fairly quickly but had terrible service from our waiter.  He took about 10 minutes just to bring me a soda because they had apparently run out of clean glasses.  How can a restaurant of this size, in a hotel of this size, in Vegas run out of clean glasses?\n\nAnyway, our waiter kept disappearing for 5-8 minutes a time within the first 20 minutes of us being seated.

We were never given an explanation as to what took so long.  I guess because it's all fresh and whatnot, but a couple sat down next to us about 15 minutes after we were seated, got their food 10 minutes before ours even showed up and they were gone before us.  Really crappy service from the waitstaff.\n\nAs for the food, it was good but I think my opinion is heavily skewed by the bad service we got.  If any server or restaurant gives you a bad impression within the first 10 minutes, chances are isn't not going to get much better and you won't be blown away by the food no matter how good it is.

I tipped the food server a 200% tip because she was the only reasonable employee in the place.  I talked to the manager Kerry and he seemed to empathize but did nothing to try to retain my business.  I don't come in every night but when I do am willing to drop at least $100 I guess they don't have to worry because $0 of my money will be spent there.

The alcohol is reasonable priced, the food is quite good, too.  My favs being Guiness (24oz) and the Bananas Foster to drink and burgers & the truffles fries for nomming.  Some exceptional items are:\n\n- Truffles Fries: \""""...tossed with white truffle oil, Parmesan cheese & fresh parsley.\"""" Contains no truffle, though still quite good.  (Google \""""white truffle oil\"""" and you'll be a bit shocked)\n\n- Prime Rib Sliders served with blue cheese & horseradish sauce.  Cooked to your temp & generally great beefy flavor with just enough bite that you don't eat the entire beef slice in your first bite. \n\nI typically go late on weekends which can be quite busy, so service does degrade a bit.  Lunch service has been good so far. \n\nGo for 2 Timin' Tuesdays for 2for1 burgers.  Eat one there & get the other to go, even!\n\nI am a repeat customer due to my preference for music, but would easily go there for the food & semi-Irish atmosphere, too.",1,1
"Ein sch\u00f6ner kleiner Flughafen f\u00fcr die schottische Hauptstadt. Von der Gr\u00f6\u00dfe und Atmosph\u00e4re her kann man ihn fast mit Tegel in Berlin vergleichen. (Nat\u00fcrlich auf die geringeren Flugbewegungen Edinburghs runtergek\u00fcrzt - m\u00f6chte ja jetzt die Berliner nicht ver\u00e4rgern ;) )\nVon einem Ende des Terminals zum anderen geht man gerade mal 10 Minuten.\n\nDurch die Sicherheitsschleuse geht man in 2 ordentlichen Schlangen (na klar, man ist ja in Gro\u00dfbritannien : Join the Queue), die dann sehr z\u00fcgig, aber sehr genau abgearbeitet wird.\n\nNachdem man die Sicherheit \u00fcberwunden hat, findet man im Abflugbereich die \u00fcblichen Duty free Shops und Verk\u00f6stigungsstellen.\n\nWas bemerkenswert ist: Das Abflugsgate wird erst ca. 45 Minuten vor Abflug auf den Monitoren bekanntgegeben. Aber da der Flughafen doch nicht sehr gro\u00df ist, hat man alle Zeit der Welt, um dahin zu schlendern.",1,0
"HACKS! Be careful if you have a food allergy and you eat here!!!! I had one of their Grandma Blacks cookies which was loaded with walnuts, which I am allergic to. After eating the cookie I went into anaphylactic shock and was hospitalized for three days. There was NO mention anywhere in this restaurant on Baseline road of walnuts being used in any of their products. Not on the menus, not on the website, not on the damn wrapper for the cookie.\nWhen I approached the owner Terry Black about getting partial compensation for the thousands of dollars of hospital bills, I was met with little sympathy. Not even an apology. I can understand the owner not wanting to fork out the dough, and I even understand that there is no hard law in AZ that states you have to list allergens on your food products. But in this age of information, business ethics and customer service is everything and unfortunately this establishment LACKS just that. Years later and they still don't have any sort of allergy warnings on their menus or website. The day after my incident, the counter girl put a hand written note on the cookie jar that said 'may contain nuts'. That note was on for a day, tops! I am no longer a customer. These guys are poor excuses for restauranteurs. Stay away! Your life may depend on it if you have a food allergy.",0,0

"Port Authority (formerly known as PATransit, or \""""PAT\"""") operates a fairly extensive network of buses and (in the South Hills) light rail. Instead of running school buses, the school district gave high schoolers bus passes to get to class, and I have used the bus since 1997.\n\nI've had a great experience using the bus in Pittsburgh. I didn't get a driver's license until I was almost 19--the bus (\""""Miss Pat\""""--another nickname) and my bike got me everywhere I needed to go. There will inevitably be delays and problems, but that is common to all modes of transportation. The price is right (especially with a \""""free\"""" bus pass; students see below) and if you live and work in the city, you should consider making the bus your main means of commuting.\n\nThe system is largely built on the legacy of pre-World War II trolley lines, so the neighborhoods that were developed before 1950 are fairly well-served, while more recent developments can be harder to navigate by bus. The system just had a major overhaul (in spring 2010) but still travel many of the same routes.\n\nThe route numbering system is complicated, and there are many exceptions, but as a rule, the routes are numbered in a counter-clockwise fashion from downtown. The \""""oughts\"""" and 10's go north, the 20's and 30's go west, the 40's and 50's go south, and the 60's, 70's, 80's an 90's go east. Routes that are just letters are express or flyer routes, which may go on one of three \""""busways,\"""" transit-only highways that bypass traffic jams. The light rail (known as the \""""T\"""" or the trolley) serves southern city and suburban neighborhoods above ground, and has three underground stations downtown, with a major construction project underway to extend trains to the North Side, projected for completion in 2011.\n\nThe University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University (among others) have agreements with the Port Authority to allow students, staff and faculty to use their university IDs as bus passes. Others can purchase passes at $75 per month or $20 per week, while a local one-way fare is $2.00. Port Authority is supposed to be rolling out a \""""smart card\"""" digital payment system (\u00e0 la WMATA's SmarTrip or London's Oyster) soon, but that remains in development.\n\nOne especially great value is the 28X, a route serving the Pittsburgh International Airport from Downtown and Oakland (the university district) via the West Busway. Fare, as of mid-2010, is $2.75, compared with taxis and other shuttles costing $30 or more. The 28X runs every half hour and takes around 35 minutes to get to the airport from downtown, or 15 minutes longer from Oakland.\n\nThe Port Authority's fare revenues cover only a fraction of its expenses, and the state and county's perennial budget problems have caused several funding crises in recent years.",1,1
This place is very friendly and relaxing. I've been getting my lashes done by Emma since April and she's the best! I've had my lashes done in the past at different salons and was not satisfied.  Highly recommended!,1,1
"This is actually kind of sad. The customer service here is very good. Food was served quickly and tasted fine. Here's my problem. I ordered a 3 pc meal. What I got was two pieces of chicken (leg & thigh) and the one thigh had been cut into two pieces. No, really, I'm not kidding! (see photo) WTF? Are you kidding me. Then, once you get to your table and sit down, you realize the Salt Police have left a note insinuating that your eating too much Sodium and you need some extra exercise if you want the salt shaker because you have to get back up and go get one. COME ON GUYS! For a $10 meal I want 3 REAL pieces of chicken and a salt shaker! Ugh!",0,1
"Wow, the rumors are true, this place serves awesome food!! \n\nMy friend and I showed up here for dinner both as first timers. We ordered a glass of Merlot, started the girlfriends chit-chat and were very relaxed.  \n\nFor entree, I ordered grilled trout with reduced vegetables (yes, they have number of delicious sounding sea food items on the menu), while my friend had chicken smothered in red wine sauce. These entrees comes with wither salad or soup. We ordered salad - which was ok, but nothing to rave about. But when the main dishes came out, we couldn't put down the fork and stop raving about them. Both of our dishes were down right delicious!\n\nI didn't really look at the rest of the menu, but I'm sure pretty much everything on the menu is great. The entrees we ordered were in $12-$14 range. It's very reasonable price considering th quality of the food.\n\nThis is a repeater for sure.",1,1
"Great executive course.  You can use your driver on about 7 holes, the other 11 will be starting with an iron.  So, it is a standard par 60 executive course.  The fairway, green, and the tee were all perfect green grass even in the middle of winter.  The carts worked great.  We went on a friday morning and there were very few other golfers.  So we took our time and really enjoyed ourselves.  \n\nThe view of Las Vegas on the back nine of this course is breath taking.",1,1

"Some of the best pie in the state! We make a special effort to visit whenever we take a trip down to Phoenix, specifically for one pie: their Jack Daniel's pecan pie. You may have seen it featured on TLC's \""""Best Food Ever,\"""" and man, is that a great label or what.\n\nTheir regular pecan pie is amazing, but the JD pie has a hint of spice in it as well, and it's absolutely worth the slightly higher price. I can't recommend it enough!",1,1

The service is good as well as the food, drinks are made right & very reasonable in price. The bartenders are people persons and very attentive. They have a jukebox for good music.  A good place to relax or to meet up with friends to have a couple of beverages. Just wish they had better smoke ventilaters within the bar.",1,1
"We went to the drive thru around 1am on a Saturday night and there was one car in front of us. We could tell there was only one person working because it took forever for her to get our order in. When we got to the window we didnt even see the girl till after a few mins. She didnt repeat the order, but said the total amount and took our card. it took about ten mins to get two smoothies, a kids cheese quesadilla and chicken Cesar salad. The girl apologize for the wait but that's all she said. We were hoping the food was fresh since it took so long but that wasn't true. \nThe quesadilla was alright, one of the smoothie was missing the sweetener, and the salad oh my gosh was nasty. It was old, and had a weird color on the leaves. If you're gonna be open for 24/7 restock your food with some fresh ones.",0,0
"My mom and I decided to eat at the Steakhouse 46.\n\nThis place may not be the new trendy hot spot for steaks and seafood but seriously, who needs it if the food sucks.  At Steakhouse 46, the food is delicious and the service is awesome.  We told our server before hand that we needed to go to a concert at a certain time and to make sure if we could be served quicker than normal.  To our surprise they delivered on their word.  Our food was served promptly and it was delicious.\n\nMy mom ordered the Chilean sea-bass. It was served with rice and a nice sauce complimented the fish very well.  It was tasty and tender.  And I ordered the lobster and filet Mignon.  My lobster was steamed nicely and my meat cooked perfectly, medium.  Overall we were satisfied and will definitely eat here again.",1,1
"Great little latin place..\n\nThe pozole is excellent, highly recommend it, as is the table-side made guacamole (even though that's a little gimmicky and it took forever to get). \n\nThe flat iron was very well cooked and really flavorful, paired perfectly with the charred leaks and little tomatilla salad but the portion was very small.\n\nI'd come back if I'm in the area but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.",1,1
"The food was good.  We ordered sushi and some yakisoba.  The reason I could not give this place a higher rating was due to two things.  First of all, we had to wait about 20 minutes for our food, when there was only one party (of four people) that were ahead of us.  I think this has to do with being a two person restaurant.  Everything is done by just two people.  Perhaps they were just understaffed that night, but I've already been to this place twice and had the same experience in both ocassions.  Secondly, the portion size is small relative to the price that they charge.  I've been to Yogi's Grill and their portion sizes for sushi were bigger.",0,0
"There's another Mr LG Tits McGee on the scene. Yup-I've had more boyfriends than published reviews on Yelp. Anyway, this time we actually go places, which is nice. I have been searching somewhat fruitlessly for a Mexican place better than Pinto in Glasgow. I think I may have found it, however they don't put any salsa on the Quesadillas, which is a big part of the experience for me. \n\nApparently he had 'booked a table' but when we walked in, it didn't look like the kind of place where you had to book-there were only three tables. \n\nI had chicken quesadillas with black bean salsa. Next time I'd go for a different salsa-because this was more like a hodge podge collection of corn and beans. We also got a side of tortilla chips with the verde salsa. It tasted okay, but I wouldn't choose it again. \n\nI'm giving this a four because of the quesadilla on its own. The spices the chicken were cooked in were bloody great. It was just a great quesadilla. I'm not in Edinburgh very much anymore, but if I am, I'll be here again. However, I'll take away- it's a bit cold inside!",1,1
"Gave this place a try after seeing the other positive Yelp reviews. The good looking photos of the food and interior didn't hurt either. It's always nice when a new restaurant feels like it could be from almost any urban city. I must say, it feels much nicer in person than the photos suggest. Mainly because of the 14 foot ceilings and the floor to ceiling windows that look out onto the new City Hall. This is a breakfast to lunch place so they close at 2:00 PM on weekdays. We arrived at 1:00 PM on a Tuesday and completely missed the crowds. We were promptly greeted, seated and had out drink orders taken by the enthusiastic waitstaff. Tried to order the Chocolate Chip Cookies with Whole Milk and the Strawberry Cheese Cake, but they had sold out. We did split the Ruben and an order of the Honey Donuts. They were both great. Another pleasant surprise, they serve decent coffee! Personally I would prefer a cup of their coffee over a Starbucks, if only for a change. I am a fan. We will return to try out some other the other menu items that looked good.",1,1
"I was super excited to check out their HUGE store. Once we started looking around, there were two distinct things I noted. 1. The quality of furniture is NOT very good when considering the pricing. 2. The sales people seemed fairly pleasant when approaching us, but I overheard several conversations between them and they were incredibly unprofessional and down right rude to each other. Geesh, competition!!!  \n\nOther than that, I have no desire to go back. I'll stick with R.C. Willey.",0,0
"Like every restaurant in the Cosmopolitan, even the Cosmo itself, Comme Ca is artfully presented and beautiful to sit in and look at.  There's outdoor seating overlooking the strip, and the right amount of lighting to take the strip in.  The noise level is moderate and a nice break from the general din in LV.\n\nAs a Californian I found the seared foie gras heavenly, so heavenly that I had two of them.  The glazed onion alongside was wonderful with the duck confit in a crisp wrap.  The steak tartare is wonderfully seasoned and perfect on the grilled bread.  Before that I go through a dozen kumamoto oysters.\n\nI've also had brunch here, there are good offerings.  I did go the healthy route and enjoyed their oatmeal.\n\nService is attentive, casual and friendly.  The offer a good wine list, and will probably make or bring whatever you'd like to have if you asked for it.",1,1
"i've seriously had hot pockets that tasted better than the pastie i got here last night. i ordered the royale, and i don't know if it was the mushrooms, or the seasoning they use on the burger, but something was off and it left a yucky taste in my mouth for hours after i ate it.\n\ni am a very picky eater, and the pastes cannot be modified. most of them (90%) contain onions or some other strange vegetable that i don't like so it's really not a good place to go unless you like a ton of shit thrown in a pastie. i think it's too much sometimes. the mashed potatoes were dry and not very garlic-y whatsoever.\n\nour waiter was an asshole. i ordered a black and tan with strongbow and a nut ale and he informed me that they wouldn't be good together. refusing to take some douchebag's advice, i ordered it anyways and it was delicious. he didn't care to check on our table at all throughout our meal, and no waters were brought to the table...halfway through we got switched to a very nice young lady. i didn't mind the set up of the bar, it was very english pub-like and actually enjoyed the atmosphere. the beer selection is impressive.\n\ni was disappointed after all of the great yelp reviews, i was expected to be blown away by these delicious little tasty treats - unfortunately they just didn't get it right this time.",0,1

"I went to Joe's for the first time on Dec 1, 2012 and it was Ahhhhmazing!!! (Or amazing for the grammar freaks). I ordered the fishermas platter and my guy friend who I went to dinner with ordered the fish and chips; both dishes were delicious! The fishermans platter/plate offered a great variety of items which included cod fillet, calamari, shrimp, and scallops. I had them grill my scallops and fish and boy did they do it just right. The calamari and shrimp I requested to be fried, together they gave me life!!!  I cannot wait to go back here, more so, bring some people and treat them. \n\nWe also ordered two sides: Mac and cheese (yum) and skillet fried corn (even more yummy). All in all it was worth every sent, a mid pricy place but I was more than satisfied. I'm itching for more as I type. Didnt get around to the desserts but they do offer a nice selection of them. For me, the \""""sweet\"""" highlight of the meal was when the guy I'd been dating for 5 mos formally asked me to be his girlfriend.

"My husband and I had a dinner at Angel's Trumpet for ~15 friends to celebrate our elopement. We came in at 2pm on a Sunday. It is an awesome space. Perfect open-air seating and spacious layout. As soon as we got there, the manager immediately started putting a row of tables together for us on their patio. Our server, Brendan, was clearly knowledgeable about the beers (noting their alcohol contents, nuanced flavors/characteristics, pairings) and provided polite and timely service. Our food was delicious! Brendan also gave my husband and I a FREE and absolutely scrumptious homemade pop-tart: chocolate cherry, so GOOD. I will let my photos speak for themselves. My *ONLY* complaint is that it was really tough to find an updated menu online. Their business website needs work. Other than that, I had a wonderful experience. Keep up the good work, Angel's Trumpet!",1,1
"Great breakfast, and it's very convenient being in the THEhotel if you are staying there. I ate here when THEhotel first opened, it was great then and seems to have maintained its consistency even many years later.

I will absolutely be back next time I stay at the THEhotel.",1,1

We went on a Monday, so there was almost no one there, but it was really nice. We got a couple drinks, and shared chips and salsa. I can't remember what drink I got, but I did like it. The chips and salsa were yummy, ate almost the whole thing by myself. For dinner I got the Spicy Black Bean and Portabello Mushroom Wrap.

The lady saw me confused as to why I was waiting so long and told me they had just been taken out of the freezer and needed to defrost. At this point I told her if they are not ready I don't want them ( who wants oysters that are defrosted then topped with some chopped onions and some slimy gross tasting yellow muck). She says they are coming right out. They were by far the worst oysters I have ever had. Thinking the taste was from the horrible preparation, disappointed, and disgusted I ate them anyway out of pure starvation. The lady never checked on me to see how it was left my water empty for most the meal and then asked if we wanted anything else. All I wanted was to get out of there I payed the 16.40 and left. I felt sick on the way home and when I got home immediately threw up everything I ate. I called back to complain and let them know the seafood they were serving is not safe.

The person I was with ordered the Stuffed Chicken, which turned out to be much better.\n\nFor appetizers, we ordered the Garlic Bread, I advice against this, it wasn't bad, but then again, there isn't much you can do wrong with 4 pieces of bread, toasted with cheese, probably the first thing anyone learns to cook.  Instead of this, go for something else a little less common, I don't even know why it's on their menu.\n\nThe food took longer than usual to come out, but nothing to be upset over.  It looks like the cook is having a tough time come up with great dishes when restricted to just local ingredients.\n\nGiven the limited choices in the tri-city area, this restaurant gets a bonus star, from 3 to 4.

It was great with the pasta.\n\nParking at Greek Isles isn't usually a problem. They have a private reserved lot that is just across the street. Or take the Lynx to the Bland station.\n\nOne warning.

"MILITARY MEMBERS HATE GOLDS - Everyone I have talked to on base, even those with memberships to Gold's, hates the place because of their greedy attitude and horrible customer service. Gold's Gyms in general and the idea of their atmosphere is second to none.  I love Golds IDEAS and their array of equipment.  This location however.... different story, here is why.\n\n     *Military:  Too many problems when moving or deploying or TDY.  Not worth the hassle or time to get a contract with them, they won't help you at all if you go somewhere there isn't a Golds, like Iraq or Afghanistan for instance.  Everyone on base warns about all their crazy fees and how junky their equipment has gotten.\n     *Staff: Literally ONE blonde girl at the front who is polite, nice, not annoying, and does her job.  Promote her, pay her more, and kick everyone else into shape.  Everyone else is frequently talking on their cell phones, talking to each other, etc, etc.  The personal trainers are more worried about checking out the girls in the gym or chatting with each other than they are with training their clients.  Just this morning I watched 2 trainers not paying attention to their clients, and those people could get hurt if they are not given direction on proper form.  They also don't do a very good job of keeping 12-15 year olds out of the gym.  Benches aren't for sitting in a gym, go back to school.\n     *Location/Hours: Less than a block from where I live, right off the 215, and 24 hours.  (The only gym within 10-15 minutes of my place and I work crazy hours sometimes, so going to the gym ANYTIME is perfect)  With most memberships you can use any Golds location, which is great if you end up at another location with a Golds in close proximity.  (Hours is the only reason I gave this location 2 stars instead of one.)\n     *Cost:  Monthly is not bad at all.  For 24 hours and what equipment they have there, good deal.  RATE LOCK AND MAINTENANCE FEES ARE BS at this location.\n     *Equipment:  Good array of machines, weights, cables, etc.... if they were maintained.  If we pay all this money to come to the gym and have it maintained, you would think SOMEONE would maintain the equipment.  Its a phillips screwdriver and an allen wrench to keep most of these machines maintained, and it is not done often, if ever.\n     *Pool: good temperature and normally empty.  Everyone I have encountered in the pool has gym etiquette.\n\nIf another 24 hours gym opens up close, I think they will put this Gold's out of business.  I loved the Gold's I went to in Phoenix.... this one is mostly a disappointment.  I'll update if things change there.",0,1

I visited this establishment last night with my brother and his wife. I started the night off with a double jack on the rocks which I was charged 10 dollars for. I went back to the bar for the same drink. This time I got a different bartender who charged me 13 dollars. At the time I didn't say anything in case the first bartender hooked it up. Instead I waited for the server and asked him the price of a double jack. When he came back he told me it was 9.50. Basically watch the prices as there is one bartender who is obviously over charging and pocketing the rest. Aside from this discrepancy I did enjoy my time and like the bar. Because it's a nice place I want to rate it higher but this one bartenders practices is not acceptable.,0,0

"I really enjoyed it. They did put ALOT of work into this place with even more crazy people to work the house. Somethings that really bugged me were the large groups we had to be in (4 to group would be a great/ isolation is key) and the unprofessional staff. We had two guys infront of us who were clearly intoxicated and ruined the entire event for us due to everytime someone approach them they were childish and mocked them back.  We told the staff inside the situation and if we could wait just to separate from them a bit but no help was offered and just told to  \""""keep moving\"""".  Once out side, we were told them same. \n\nGet the VIP tickets. The line outside with out them was crazier then ever.",0,0
"I finally got a chance to taste what everyone has been talking about! Really fresh food, really good food and lots of it. \n\nI had the veggie quesadilla, a side of beans and a roasted jalapeno. The veggie quesadilla was simple - cheese, avocado, lettuce and peppers - but it was still tasty. I'm a sucker for beans, and although these weren't the best I'd ever had, they were still really good. I chopped up the jalapeno and added it to the beans. \n\nThe 3.5 star rating that America's Taco Shop currently has (as of the beginning of January 2011) is not at all representative of the food and service that you'll get at the Shop.

"A great place for Breakfast.  My wife and I...tired of the expensive Las Vegas Strip foods...and the cheap buffet's off strip buffet's, decided to give \""""The Cracked Egg\"""" a try.  We were not disappointed!  The menu is extensive...and most dishes are priced an average of $11.  We are skillet crazed and the Egg delivered! I had the \""""Bacon-Cheeseburger Skillet\"""" and my wife had a build your own skillet with sausage, tomato's, onions and cheese.  Cheeseburger for breakfast you say?  It was just chock full of ground beef, plenty of cheese, home style potatoes and fresh bacon galore.  I added a side of hollandaise to top my perfectly cooked eggs over easy and voila...taste perfection.  No skimping here.  The place was typical strip mall diner style seating...the staff friendly and helpful...all in all a great place to catch a great hearty breakfast! \n\n Hungry for lunch...check the backside of the menu for sandwiches, burgers etc.  But the breakfast is the draw..I mean...it is called \""""The Cracked Egg\"""" afterall.",1,1

"This is a chain restaurant, but they are fanatical about the quality of their food and service.  It's a little pricey at around $20-$25 a plate for a dinner entree but the food is high quality.\n\nLet's get our priorities in order:\n\nIn terms of drinks, I had a vodka tonic (Well vodka there is Smirnoff but they also carry Ketel One) and a Watermelon Margarita.  The vodka tonic was about what you'd expect.  A decent neutral drink with a splash of citrus.  The Watermelon Margarita was a little sweet for my taste but it was definitely an interesting experience and certainly strong enough and big enough.  It's a $9 drink but it comes with a sidecar caraffe that will completely refill the Margarita glass and then some so it's really like 2 margaritas for under five bucks each.\n\nNow that that's out of the way let's discuss dessert:\n\nI had a bite of the cheesecake which was tasty, but not award winning.    \n\nEntrees:\nI tried the NY strip and a lobster tail, both of which were well prepared though I'm not a huge fan of their spice rub.  It's not bad mind you, I just prefer my steaks either naked or marinated.  The good news is their steaks are never frozen and the quality of the cuts I saw looked pretty high (mine was good).  The lobster tail was good.  I'd say comparable to Red Lobster which is probably about all you can expect for a chain restaurant in the desert.  Besides, I like Red Lobster so that's not intended to be a slight, it's just not the same as living in port towns and having fresh local seafood available which is an entirely different thing.\n\nThe house garden salad was nothing to write home about, but it wasn't disgusting either.  They rounded up the usual suspects (Iceberg, Carrots, an onion ring, a couple of cucumbers and some cherry tomatoes) and held them for questioning in an average sized bowl.  it was about what you'd expect for a dinner salad at a steak place.\n\nThe bread was fresh and delicious.  I liked the taste better than that brown stuff they serve at Outback.\n\nMy baked potato was pretty much what you'd expect from a baked potato. Split down the middle with butter in it.  It was good, but I couldn't finish it as I had too many other competing morsels to contend with.\n\nAll in all the food was good and my only complaint was that I ate too much.  I would definitely go again.",1,1
"I go to this store occasionally to buy some spices which I cannot get in other places. The price here is one of the highest in Las Vegas with low-average quality goods. Be careful to read the bill before you leave, I have been charged of goods I never bought. Personally I wont suggest this store If you are looking for quality items at cheap or moderate price because they don't offer either.",0,0
"First time actually staying here ...\n\n+1 for getting an upgrade to the panorama suite SO AWESOME - view of the strip and bellagio water show\n+1 for the service being fairly nice -- except for one guy working at the platinum check-in desk. \n+1 for having a lively casino area -- music, dancers, young crowd\n+/-1 for the movie themes in each room. Kind of scary because they have the actual costumes that the actors wore in cases around the room. We had hamlet, moulin rouge, and grease. The hamlet one we had to cover with a bed sheet. \n-1 for the people who try to promote the club at ph \""""open bar till 4am for $20\"""" --- yeah as long as you hold your pink cup. We didn't go but thanks to fellow yelpers we were saved from being tricked. \n\nDefinitely stay here again. I've stayed at the Venetian in the past -- it's cool but this place is geared towards a younger demographic.",1,1
The food here is pretty good. The mac and cheese is creamy and the chicken strips are awesome. The service is good and the price is fair. They have a bunch of sauces as well so there is probably going to be something for everybody. If you eat inside they have whatever game happens to be on which is great.,1,1
Nice set up in here with the bar in a horseshoe type shape in the center and tables surrounding both sides of the bar.  Great place to watch a game- plenty of flat screens...\n\nI ordered the turkey club which had a weird name that I can't recall.  It was excellent- really good quality turkey and avocado on sourdough served w fries.  \n\nThe drinks are STIFF!  Get a stiffy!  Haha,1,1
"This is one of the prettiest places to dine in the Phoenix Metropolitan area.\nSomeone once told me that historically the place had been a brothel in the 1920's. It has kind of a Shangrila Hacienda feel to it. There is a little pond in the walled courtyard/outide dining area stocked with waterfowl, and on several occasions I have seen a wild Great Blue Heron inside!\nWhen my parents came to visit from Massachusetts I chose a hotel destination close to this place because I think it really feels like a vacation in here!\nThe food is pretty good. They have this deep fried Machacca and grilled green onion thing that they serve with warm melted cheese and hot tortillas which is kind of fun for a group.\nI like the Rellenos here. They have picadillo in them.\nThe bar area is large with a nice fireplace and well stocked with a good roasted tasting salsa and chips, as well as plenty of icewater pitchers while you sometimes have to wait for your table.\nVery picturesque and great for photo-ops or possibly a wedding party or something.\nNot the most incredible food on earth, but neither is it ever disappointing, and the view here at sunset is like magic.",1,1
"I love the concept of this place...its fun and hip and cool...lol...there are some very creative burger combonations and they are good...my favorite part of their menu is the truffle fries, sweet potato fries, and shoe string fries...and of course their shakes OMG!!!! The banana foster shake is something out of this world it is definitely worth going there for that...i would choose some places burgers over here but i really like it!! I like to meet up here with friends and family for a fun little night out...they do have a good wine selection as well...",1,1
Wow.. I can't believe I haven't posted a review for this place!\n\nI'm  inspired to write this review after a recent poor experience at a local sephora store here in Calgary Canada. \n\nI've had one of the most memorable shopping experiences at this specific Sephora store. The staff here is AMAZING. Completely worth me saving every single loonie (dollar dollar bills) to go back and make all my makeup purchases here. I am an excessive makeup buyer.. and am committed to only going here! Yes well worth the travel and wait. \n\nI must say that the makeup artist who helped us (Lino) was AMAZING. He helped me explore new makeup and looks and... sigh. Wish he lived here and could be my personal makeup consultant all the time! \n\nI highly recommend stopping in here and asking a sales rep for help with a new look. Everyone there was so knowledgeable. Wish service like this was found everywhere.,1,1
"the day after a late night staying up baking an emergency sponge cake for a bake sale, means i was in no mood for cooking my own dinner when i finally returned home after work.  what it did mean though was a quick browse on justeat.co.uk and an order placed to los cardos.\ni've had take away from this place a few times before and was very excited when they added carnitas to their filling options.  what i really love is that they do burrito bowls meaning i can get the best of the burrito without having to take on the extra calories of the tortilla wrap.  (those extra calories generally go to the lovely fresh tortilla chips they have, a huge bag for only \u00a31.40!!)\nmy burrito bowl tonight was carintas with pinto beans, pico de gallo, cheese, sour cream, and guacamole.  it was a lovely combination, especially the fresh guacamole, and the only draw back was the plain rice at the bottom of the box.  while everything else was very tasty and fresh the rice was just bland, boring white rice with no seasoning in it. \nthe fresh tortilla chips were extra good because for some reason they gave me not one, but two bags! (does anyone want to have a bag and a halfish of tortilla chips???)  they went very well with the slightly spicy salsa verde.  the whole meal was washed down well with a peach iced tea.  i love a place that sells iced tea as this seems to be a rarity in the UK!  but being american i do enjoy a nice iced tea every now and then :)\nanother excellent point was their service, they called me to check that the phone number and address was right before setting out for delivery.  very thoughtful and it meant my food was delivered quickly, much under the predicted 45 minutes that justeat.co.uk told me.\nthere are two reasons i've not given this place five stars, one is the bland rice, which would be so easy to fix, just mix in some chopped up coriander and lime juice, delish! the second is the minimum delivery order of \u00a312 since i've generally spent less than \u00a310 when i pick it up from the restuarant.  something else they should look into as other take aways have a minimum delivery starting at \u00a36 which is much more reasonable.\neither way though, this definitely filled the fresh and tasty no fuss dinner that i needed tonight and now it's time to finish up the dish washing from my frantic baking!!",1,1
"So happy to see Viva Mercado's open again.  Love the new location.  The food was great as we expected.  The salsa is my favorite in town, just the right amount of spice and not too chunky.  I'm a big fan of the bean and cheese burrito enchilada style (of course).  I also like the cheese enchiladas and beef tacos (crispy).\n\nIt was great to see some familiar faces working there and the staff was fast and friendly.  Can't wait to go back again.",1,1
"Well we went and tried it and not my favorite. I've been to many places in Las Vegas for sushi and this one did not hit its mark. Two things high prices that are not justified and service was so so. Never brought our edamame we ordered and put it on the bill. Rolls were extremely generic. Fake caterpillar roll had no flavor along with sex on the beach which tasted like rice vinegar that overpowered the whole roll. Salmon sashimi was not cut correctly, it was cut like the crab sticks which detracted from its presentation and flavor. Burning sensation roll with soft shell crab, avo, and tuna was swimming in a garlic ponzu and for some reason here was a heaping mound of rice on my plate. Overall not impressed and won't be back. Many other sushi places to try in Vegas for better food and service.",0,0
"This place is really close by my apartment, it's open 24 hours and it's cheap; the perfect trifecta. It's the reason I used to come here a lot, not that I ever loved the place but it was convenient. Kinda like sex in 105 degree weather, it's not what you really want but it's there.\n\nSo, I know this two-star review means the Badger and I are officially breaking up. Alas, it has to be done. I'm done with the abuse, I have to move on. \n\nI always get their chicken wings. Everyone raves about their burgers, which are good, but no one would rave about them if they weren't $5. If I want a cheap burger, I'll go to In N Out. If I want a great burger, I will go to Holsteins or Fat Choy's. I don't mind paying more for a great burger and this city is full of them. But you can't beat the price of their chicken wings, I get the 18 huge wings with fries for around $15. It  makes at least three meals for me. \n\nThe taste is okay but here's the straw that broke the camel's back: today they were underdone. They weren't bloody and health dept-needs-to-shut-them-down-raw. They were more soft in the middle, near the bone and I could feel raw meat when I bit into it. It was just gross. \n\nSo to air out the relationship's dirty laundry, I never did care for the grimy look of the place, the annoying waitresses (although today's waitress was nice), the curt phone calls and the misquoting of prices over the phone and website. \n\nSorry Badger, it was a nice run but it wasn't working out... \n\nIn the infamous words of Taylor Swift, \""""We are never, ever, EVER getting back together\""""",0,0
"Contrary to popular opinion, Mandalay Bay is NOT all that and a bag of chips.  It's just hype, and I'm not sure the hype is all that and a bag of chips, either.   Yes, Mandalay Bay is contrived hype, with a stale premise for manipulation.\n\n* Convention Center.  Lots of natural lighting when possible so you don't feel like you're caged up in hell. Clean facilities, considerate staff.  Now if they could just figure out a way to make the room temperature more human friendly so that I don't feel like I want to shrivel up and die before the vampires get me.  \n\n* Restaurants: Meh, I've had better.  If you are going to dine finely, go to Aria for the hot new menus.  The restaurants in Mandalay Bay embody the ignorant Americanism that is Vegas - boring, ethnocentric, and bland.\n\n*Rooms: Egad Watson! These rooms suck. The pictures and the crap lighting create the perception of a nicely designed room, but it's all a house of cards underneath.  Bed sheets that don't fit properly, bath towels that feel like sandpaper against your skin, a cruel lack of bathroom countertop, chipped paint, and lame water pressure.  If I'm paying a premium for the room, I want to be able to rinse out my conditioner in 5 minutes or less.  Thanks. \n\n*Fitness Amenities - you have to pay for the gym, and the gym is not worth $20 a day - pretty small, stale air, etc.. The walking track around the pool is nice, as long as you are ok with getting run over by the hotel staff in golf carts.  \n\nI won't stay here again if I can help it! Even if there is a convention that I need to attend, I'd rather slum it in The Luxor for half the room rate and the free gym.",0,0
This was my second visit to this location. I received a lot of food for my money but the food is just okay... I love Mexican food and this place is just cranking it out without any real quality. The service was fine and I did not think it took long to wait for my food. I'm passing on this one.,0,1

Thought we'd try something new other than Papa Johns. I'm very pleased to say we will be ordering from here in the future. \n\nWe were pretty skeptical whether or not we needed a large or extra large so we went to the XL Venezia supreme and hot wings. \n\nThe tasting of the pizza and wings were exquisite! Not too much marinara and just enough cheese. Our order was expected 45 to an hour wait but we ended up waiting about 40 minutes. \n\nVery satisfied with our first experience.,1,1
I have enjoyed Postino's for a long time.  The Monday and Tuesday night madness are for those who have the patience to have a great deal.  This location is great due to the patio and indoor seating.

"Went here on Saturday night, 9:00pm, 11/16/13.  As I was in-town on business, I was alone.  There was plenty of parking for my double-cab, 8' bed, full sized truck.  Walked right in and had a table in 3 minutes.  Ambience is slightly upscale.  The men were dressed like you'd expect in the main dining room of a cruise ship.  The waitresses looked matronly, primarily because of their matronly uniform.  I guess the costume is some sort of a maid's uniform, which included a white cap.  I did not laugh to myself because they, and the rest of the establishment was indeed fairly classy.  No teenagers worked here. \n\n I had a salad, med-rare prime rib, creamed corn, spinach, and  Yorkshire pudding.  Yorkshire pudding is a special bread that you dip your remaining au-juice and other juices off your plate with.  The salad came with a house dressing that seemed to be a mixture of catalina/tomato and french.   The dressing was light and not very thick at all.  The waiter did NOT ask me what kind of dressing I want, so that might be all there was.  but it was sooooo good!  The dinner also  came with sourdough bread and butter.  Don't let the name \""""creamed corn\"""" turn you off.  It's not the stuff you pour out of a can at home.  It really is very good.  Although the prim rib itself is very, very good, it really is no better than places such as The Outback and Texas Roadhouse.  So go for the ambience, or spinach, creamed corn.  If not, go somewhere cheaper.   \n\nBecause of the ambience, creamed corn and spinach, I will be back!  (For sure.)",1,1
"If you have kids, stop reading this review, open up another window and book a stay here. I am not a water park person but this place is awesome. Everything is crazy clean, even the arcade and water park which can be notorious filth magnets. I was so impressed with the number of lifeguards at the park- it seemed like they were everywhere and they were incredibly focused. I am a bit overprotective when it comes to my kids and water but I was able to relax and even read a book! I was a bit worried that my 10 and 7 year olds would get bored after a while but we opened and closed the water park down each day. The rides are fun and the lines move very quickly. It is pricey here because basically you are paying for comfort and ease of everything at your fingertips. There are tons of restuarants around Great Wolf but who wants to stop having fun and leave? So, just accept that you are going to pay for the convenience of being able to eat semi-decent amusement park food in your bathing suit. There were some healthier choices at the restaurants but it wasn't gourmet fare by any means. If you get tired of the water park there is an arcade, ten pen bowling, mini-golf, a Magic Quest game and even performances and story time in the great hall. This place is very focused on kids (seriously, it is kid heaven) but adults will still have a good time, even if that means you actually get to sit at a table by yourself and read for a few hours.",1,1

"This is one of the best places to watch a football game in the area, or any sport for that matter. There are daily deals, and specials that are offered, which make them different than a lot of the overpriced sports bars across Arizona. Not everyone is upper-middle class or in the 1%, so it's great to see that value is taken into account with their pricing, as well as consideration to the everyday man's wallet. $6 wings during happy hour during the week?! Need I say more? Yes, I actually do, because this bar won an award for best wings in the Phoenix Times (try their unique sweet style--none like them). However, they offer a lot more than that fooodwise, and the portions are wonderful. When you order a salad, you get a REAL salad, and can even feel a little satisfied after the darn thing. When you order a ZIPP's burger, you get a REAL burger. When you order a...well, I think you get the idea.\n\nAll that rambling, and I didn't even talk about the service! Wow. Shame on me, but it's surprising in this era of lack of customer service and manners, to find a place that values its customers, and treats them like so, in the establishment itself. I've been here many times, and I've never been disappointed. If by chance you have, or had a bad experience, give it a second shot.

Yes our waitress might not refill our apple juices very quickly, but I can't blame her for all the tables she had to deal with. I'm a reasonable person. =]\n\nSecond, I went during breakfast...I only enjoyed eating the \""""build your own omelet\"""" and crepe station (they rush you, so the crepe is a bit soggy...not like Bacchanal Buffet...patience). The crab legs didn't taste that good either...not fresh. The carving station only had prime rib, ham, and sausage...however there was no one to slice the meat...so everything became dry. The dishes that they displayed didn't look very appetizing...so I didn't even try it. (Didn't want to get sick).\n\nLastly, I am sad to say that I wouldn't suggest coming here for breakfast. I haven't came here for awhile for dinner, but if I do...I'll update this...However, it may be awhile...I'm addicted to Bacchanal Buffet now =]\n\nNote: Unlimited beer, mimosas, and wine for $12.99",0,0

It was perfect as is. My boyfriend ordered a pepperoni pizza and the waiter wanted to make sure he was okay with the oregano and spicy pepperoni they now use (which he was), I had the chicken tequila fettuccine w/extra cilantro. As he was putting in the order he turned to just confirm I wanted extra cilantro which I did. \n\nThe manager brought our food over in less than 10 minutes and it was perfect!

During busy times (like lunch), they've given the sandwich I've ordered away more times than I can count. \n\nBut my biggest complaint is that, if you order an unwitch, they only put use one measly piece of lettuce. This is supposed to replace the bread, folks! I've never been to a Jimmy John's that does such a terrible job with their unwitches. It's so frustrating, because it's such an easy fix.

"Good for dates, good for a quick eat, good for family- it's a pretty well-balanced restaurant.  Service is great, decor is stunning, everything is just right.  \n\nThe reason why I'm giving Hachi 4 stars is because establishments that I give 5 stars to usually have a \""""wow, oh holy %^&\"""" factor that applies to them.

"I feel like I'm in the minority, but I wasn't really wowed by this place. A small group of coworkers wanted Mexican for dinner, this was near our office so here we went. You have to valet your car which is kind of annoying, but the guys were nice and the inside where the restaurant is pretty impressive decor wise, so I was in a good mood. \n\nOnce our group trickled in, we ordered some drinks and I used my check-in deal to get free chips & guac for the table. I had the pineapple margarita which was delicious, but a little on the small side, the rest of the tables got different types of margaritas and all seemed to enjoy them. The waiter came out and explained that it's a tapas style restaurant (probably wouldn't have picked this place had I known that, $8-14/plate is pretty steep imho) and so we all decided on what we would order. If I remember correctly, we had the\n\nTacos de mahi mahi - didn't try these, but heard they were good. \n\nTacos de camarones - didn't try, no complaints\n\nTacos de pollo - I enjoyed these, though I wish the tortillas were a little bigger for all of the things they cram onto them\n\nTamale - I really liked this. Has a bit of a kick to it\n\nPollo ahumado a la yucateco - alright. I'm not a fan of sweet poultry I guess, but everyone else liked it. \n\nChips & salsa - very good\n\nAbout halfway through I ordered a Michelada. Due to my ignorance and the misleading description on the menu (Modelo especial, lime, spices, salt), I didn't know I was ordering the GROSSEST drink in the world. My fault, and I just drank the rest of the modelo out of the bottle, but I was surprised no one asked me about it. There was also a fly in it, but as I was with coworkers I didn't want to cause a scene over it (my fault, lesson learned). Another slightly annoying thing is that the glass windows on the side of the building slide open (which is actually pretty cool), but the one or two times they did this to get out to the patio they let flies in, which were buzzing around our table nonstop. The servers saw us batting them away but no one offered a slight \""""sorry about that\"""". All in all, 5 dishes and 7 drinks ran us about $150. If these were main dishes, I'd be indifferent, but for the value of what you pay for vs. what you get, I can't recommend Distrito.",0,0
"The owner was incredibly rude to us, and we are at a loss for why. Perhaps it is because we are tourists and speak little French? Or maybe she doesn't like students? (strange for a college town). We thought we were being respectful -- we said hello with a smile, we handled her (wonderful) books with care, we even asked her questions about where to find books. But she became incredibly agitated when my friend tried to get a book that was a bit higher than we could reach -- she insisted that he just put the book away altogether and escorted him out of the store, as if he had committed a crime. She then promptly turned to me and glowered, obviously wishing to kick me out as well. I was going to buy the book I had been skimming, but felt incredibly uncomfortable with how she was treating us. As I tried to put the book I was holding back, I couldn't recall where it belonged, and she rudely grabbed it from me, muttered something unintelligible in French to my untrained ears, and with that I left to regroup with my friend outside so that we could try and understand what we had just experienced.\n\nIt honestly breaks my heart -- this could have been a memorable little bookstore with a fantastic collection, a collection that the owner is clearly very passionate about, but instead it will be the bookstore where we had the meanest encounter with a book proprietor I have ever encountered.",0,0
"I'm sure it's excellent -- but after waiting on line for 30 minutes on a Saturday morning, we sat down and realized that their menu is pretty small, and almost all dishes contain some sort of pork.

This is authentic/gourmet type dishes in a casual setting that includes an outdoor patio and bar.  The scale of the whole place is small and intimate.  I had seafood crepes in some kind of avocado sauce.  The plates around me looked equally delightful, from the traditional mole to the carnitas to the mango crab salad.

"We went in January for dinner as my husband received a gift card. Yes, this place is pricey, but well worth it. The service is phenomenal. They even have bathroom attendants! \n\nMy husband got the bone-in filet and I got the king crab legs. He ordered the wedge salad and I had the chopped salad. We had the sugar snap peas and scalloped potatoes as sides. Even though he asked for the filet as medium, it came medium rare. He didn't mind. I had a bite and while it was very tender, I would have sent it back for more cooking. My king crab legs were fantastic. Perfectly cooked - not too salty or too watery. The sugar snap peas were crisp and the scalloped potatoes were very rich. \n\nOur server was spot on until we finished our meal. She was being attentive to a large table, but we were ignored for a good 10-15 minutes once our entree dishes were cleared. This is the reason I didn't give 5 stars. \n\nI think this is a great place to go for a special occasion dinner. We're not the only ones who think that because the restaurant was packed in early January.",1,1
"Most sushi places end up with a bill with around $15-30/person depending on how much you order or where you go.  Unless you are going to be planning on eating a second dinner or drinking a lot, usually you need more food afterwards to settle your stomach.\n\nMido sushi has all you can eat $20 sushi.  I have been to places like this, such as Todai.  The significant difference between Mido and Todai is that they ask you what you want to order and it is freshly made.  The all you can eat also comes with a soup, salad, tempura, edamame, hot tea, and ice cream (get the mango, has a few chunks of real mango).  I didn't waste too much space other than the sushi, and that is what I recommend if you want to get a bang for your buck.  I think between the 4 of us, we ordered around 25 rolls of sushi.\n\nAs much as the sushi was excellent, the service is a hit or miss depending on the mood of the servers.  I think last night was a good night, but I have heard they can be crabs.  I also heard they actually ask you why you don't tip at least 15%.  In my opinion, even though tip is very standardized, I still feel you have to earn your tip.  My standard is 20% for far exceeding service, 15% for great service, and 12% for average service, 10% or sometimes less for poor service.\n\nWhen we entered, they had a disco ball and some music playing for someone's birthday.

"THE INTRO:\n--Despite my low two-star rating attributed to this restaurant, I would point out that it is a brand-new restaurant and they may be still working out some of the kinks.  I would consider this as you read my review.  We were at the restaurant for 2.5 hours.  My goal when deciding on a restaurant this evening was to dine with a couple (2) of friends that just wanted to have a nice sit-down meal to celebrate someone's birthday.  We ultimately chose this restaurant because it was new, had done some great marketing, and there was a lot of hype about the quality of the food, the d\u00e9cor and the location.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n--the d\u00e9cor is great - walls made out of solid concrete with a cool fireplace (it's not real fire, but very cool nonetheless), comfortable seats, a couple of wine cellars, soft lighting but still strong enough to see everything nicely, and a winding staircase going up to the second floor; and\n--the quality of the steak - it was cooked just the way I ordered (rare) and had a wonderful charcoal-tasting sear on the outside.  Contrary to another poster, the steak was not drenched in salt.\n\nTHE BAD:\n--speed of kitchen service - anything that we ordered from the kitchen (whether that was a snack, appetizer, main dish, or dessert) took a long time to arrive.  Excessively long.  We ordered a bottle of wine to accompany our main meal (we had had martinis with the snacks, etc., before the main meal).  The waitress brought over the bottle (Penfolds Bin 9) immediately after the main meal was ordered and, amazingly, we managed to finish off the bottle of wine before the steak arrived!  We didn't \""""chug\"""" back the wine, either: we took our time.  Service was equally slow for the starters\n--I feel bad saying this, but our waitress just didn't seem to fit in this calibre of restaurant--there was just something about her service that was a little \""""off\"""" by the comments that she made to us during the meal and her general demeanor came off as a bit \""""brusque\"""";\n--the quality of the starters - we ordered smoked cheese fritters and Japanese dumplings.  The dumplings were warm, not hot.  The quality was only okay.  Unfortunately, in a place like this, \""""okay\"""" doesn't cut it.  You'll see why in the next line; and\n--the quality / quantity / price ratios (le rapport qualit\u00e9-prix) - the bill came out to $100 / person but the size of the dishes (quantity) and the taste of the food (quality - except for the steak which was great) just didn't justify the price, and that's taking into consideration the nice d\u00e9cor.",0,0
"This is easily the best gym I've ever been to. The old UNLV gym was a dank basement like facility, so UNLV built this beautiful gym two years ago.\n\nThe first floor has dozens of treadmills, elliptical machines, mats, a few dependent stair steppers and two working independent stair steppers. There are also racquetball courts and volleyball courts on the first floor. If you are a student the health center is also there, so if you need to see a doctor for something minor pop in and make an appointment. The locker rooms are also on the first floor,.\n\nThe second floor has a myriad of weight lifting machines and free weights. There are also a few elliptical and treadmills if you prefer to do cardio on the same floor you are strength training on. Most of the group classrooms are also on this floor, which leads me to another fantastic aspect of this facility, the group exercise classes that are included with your membership. From yoga to \""""boot camp,\"""" they have a class for all levels of fitness. Check out the schedule on the SRWC Facebook or pick up a physical copy at the front desk.\n\nThe third floor has basketball courts, offices and more group exercise rooms.\n\nThe four floor has an indoor track. It's got kinda sharp turns, and people like to walk in the wrong direction, but it is still nice.\n\nThe reason I've deducted one star is that they don't enforce most of the rules. People will goof around on the equipment, leave bags on the weight lifting machines, loudly drop weights that they can't handle and not wipe down seats. Oh and for some reason it takes 30 seconds to five minutes longer to check in if you have Scarlet and Gray (the program that compensates students who paid the fee before the gym was built).",1,0

"Very salesy and pushy IMHO\n\nI arrived with the intent purpose of test driving a vehicle. I was very upfront with the salesman when I arrived. I told him I was interested in a certain line of luxury vehicles and wanted to test drive cars in a particular class. I told him I wasn't buying today and wanted to make an informed decision. I showed him my 90K Mercedes outside to show I was a credible client and not someone just wasting his time.  I told them my intent was not to buy today because I wanted to test drive the Audi, Mercedes, Lexus etc before buying. Even after telling him this, he sat me down on a couch. He asked me a lot of unnecessary questions despite knowing I was there to test drive a car. When I test drove the car, the salesman was very condescending. I look young so I assumed he thought I was a kid in my early 20's  even though I'm in my late 30's and a professional. He was a back seat driver and was directing me turn by turn. After the drive, he didn't drop me off at the showroom. I had to ride with him back into the garage where he applied more pressure sales tactics. He then re-asked many of the same questions he had already asked. He asked them in different ways and assumed I was an idiot and didn't recognize his cheap tactic. We then stopped on the second floor so I could \""""use the bathroom.\"""" His desk is on the showroom floor which is the first floor. They stop on the second floor to further delay you and engage you in further conversation. Then we took the elevator down to the first floor. He then walks me past his desk to re-ask the same questions he had been asking me all day. This was essentially their last ditch effort to see if I would purchase a car from them. The salesman even mocked his own tactics. He said \""""The chances of you returning are about 30% when you leave the door so what can we do to sell you a car now.\""""  When I asked about pricing, the salesman said he doesn't know anything about numbers and that pricing was done by \""""them.\""""  I gathered he just shows you the vehicle and they bring in a closer to work the deal. This is pretty typical of most dealerships. The salesman is the \""""good cop\"""" and the closer is the \""""bad cop.\""""  I eventually left the dealership but not after wasting an additional 30 minutes of babysitting a salesman who thought he was being clever in applying these tactics. I expect this at a GM dealership but was very surprised to witness this at a premium luxury dealership. \n\nI test drove  cars at Mercedes and Audi across the street. None of their sales representatives were as pushy as the Chapman BMW reps. None of them called me after my test drive. They were intelligent enough to recognize that if I was interested in buying a car from them, I would call them. Just from the pushy and overzealous sales tactics, I would never buy a BMW here. I would rather buy a BMW from another state and ship it than do business here. I just got a very bad vibe from this place. I would encourage the sales manager to not encourage aggressive and pushy sales tactics because most of us who can afford BMW's are professionals and don't appreciate those types of tactics.

"I personally love this bakery but it is too far away!!  From bakery to bakery you will find that the sugar content changes even when comparing what you think are \""""like\"""" products. For instance, a cream puff, if you are at a french bakery the cream puff may look the same but they generally go lighter on the sugar ingredient so you may even be able to detect a slight egg taste in the pastry, Jewish bakeries and Mexican bakeries also tend to go lighter on the sugar so although it is a tasy treat I often walk away thinking it was good but I have had better. Great Buns bakes the way I like it. The Cream Puffs a light and fluffy and sweet like I believe a dessert should be. Not sugary, mind you, just sweet and delicious. Obviously there are bakeries that have slightly changed their recipes to meet the American sweet tooth market and this is one of those bakeries.\n\nAs an extra bonus, if you call them and tell them you are looking for a certain treat such as a Napolean, if they don't have them available that day they will try to accomodate your request by making them the following day or day after.

"I have a very entertaining experience at the Sushi Room that I will gladly tell while keeping names private (so as to not piss anyone off). Note that this is a whiiiiiileee back so I don't know if their staff is still the same. Phew\n\nSo my date and I show up really late on a Thursday night. The place is essentially empty except for a couple of people at the bar. We order a couple sake bombs, 2 rolls (spicy tuna and a salmon roll) and some korean-style ribs. The sushi was pretty tasty (very standard, nothing out of the world) but the ribs were pretty hard to eat with the chopsticks and had a bit of fat. Still, it was decent appetizers and HH pricing at night, so we were pretty complaisant with our choices. They had a couple choices of sake which I appreciated, so we went with the drier (less sweet) option. With HH prices, it ended up being about $25 for the both of us. Pretty darn good. \n\nHalfway through our meal we notice that we are the only ones left there and that the staff is busting up the volume (90's rap) and dancing to it.

Also, I requested more chairs for our poker game, but they didn't have any housekeeping staff to get us chairs.\n\nThe room was decent sized, 3 flat screens, the bedrooms were quite large but I wish the br's were a bit smaller so that the living space could have been bigger as I brought in a poker table so we could play a friendly game of poker.\n\nI requested a non-smoking ground floor 2br suite close to parking and that's exactly what they gave me. My car was 5 ft from my front door. Ha! Stay at one of the mega hotels and if you self park, you will spend 5-15 minutes walking to your car if you can find it. Free coffee in the office, FREE hi-speed internet but bring a RJ45/Cat 5 cable. However, my roommate was able to access free wifi as well, but we were about 30 ft from the registration office, so maybe we were lucky or there's free wifi in the office that is not advertised.I did bring my own wifi router and was able to successfully configure it so that I could use it in the suite. I preferred it so that I could have better wifi security, but I did test out the existing wifi and it seemed to work fine on my laptop. \n\nLocation: I prefer staying off the strip so I actually consider it a plus. Usually I stay Downtown on Fremont St. so I guess I'm a freak that I don't like staying on the Strip. So be it. I like saving the money, avoiding the horrific traffic and drunk drivers. But I usually go to Vegas to play poker and will go to the various different casinos where I hear of a good cash game or well structured tournament.",1,0
"After rafting at the USNWC, I was craving some OTB chips and salsa, so we had a late lunch on the way home.

"I absolutely loved this restaurant. \n\nMy dining experience here was so close to perfection. We had our first dinner here, and after a long day of travel, we were hungry (and you don't want to mess with six hungry Asian girls). \n\nIf it's a warm night, make sure to get a table on the terrace. It is so beautiful and the water show is so much fun. It's a little strange and quirky, but after a few drinks, it is awesome entertainment. There was a table full of middle aged folks next to us, and at one point, a couple got up and started dancing in the dining area. Our dinner had turned into a party :)\n\nThis restaurant is elegant, and feels warm when you walk in. The servers were very nice, but they are SO busy. It took them a while to get to our order, the the food came out fast after we did get the server.\n\nGreat cocktail menu, even better dinner menu. I highly recommend the Hamachi Cru - it is thin slices of Yellowtail with an avocado puree, orange slices with thin slices of a baguette. The portion size is pretty generous, and it is absolutely delicious. \n\nFor the main course, I had the pancetta wrapped Halibut. It was very flavorful,  moist and cooked perfectly. It came in a green pea puree with other seasonal vegetables. \n\nWe were too full for dessert, but the menu looked SO good. Also, the Wynn looks like a fabulous hotel.. I'll have to stay there on my next trip :)",1,1
"I have eaten their food for years now at several locations.  It usually tastes the same at all. Decent\n\nToday, my noodles were burnt. If I were to imagine what a melted plastic fork would taste like, this would be it.\n\nI stomached thru a few bites before doing the unthinkable.  I sent it back.  If an employee had not come by my table and asked if all was good I would have finished eating and left.\n\nThe crab rangoons were good and I really like the chai vanilla tea.   My replacement meal was of the normally expected quality.\n\n\nI think today they had a bad chef.  My friend that went with me said his meal sucked too.\n\n\n\nI will eventually eat their food again but it won't be my sugestion to go.\n\n\nOne possibility for the bad food could be this.

"Love this place. Family-run, family-friendly neighborhood Italian restaurant. Their take-out/delivery is so-so in my experience, so dine in--I've never had a bad meal. Their red sauce is distinctive and the pasta tastes home-made--no corners cut, nothing from a can, so far as I can tell. Warm, friendly atmosphere. Occasionally they have live music on Fridays and Saturdays. I've always gone with my 3yo in tow, and they've always been patient and kind with him. Excellent place for parents who want a civilized meal at a place where their kids will be welcome.",1,1

"Negative stars! Don't waste your time and money there. I was there this weekend and  I was very disappointed. I got bored and was close to walking out, and the only reason I didn't was because I paid a lot of money. They tried coping Medieval Times and it's just a big FAIL. My kid didn't even enjoy it . Medieval time is 100x times better. The only thing that got my attention was the fireworks and even then I didn't think it was all that. The acting was terrible. They did have dancers but after a while they got boring and lost all purpose. The food wasn't good and the waiter was a jerk, I asked him for straws and he threw them in my table.  First of all Vegas is not for kids, but if you do take them and want to have fun do something else.   Adults must be pretty drunk in order to enjoy this show.",0,0

"I've eaten here twice and each time I haven't been all that impressed.  The food isn't terrible but it's not that great either.  \n\nMy first experience was about 2 months ago and I was incredibly hungry for lunch.  My coworker mentioned this place and I was excited to try something new.  The chips and salsa are pretty good.  There were three of us in the party and we all ordered different dishes but they seemed to only screw up mine.  I ordered the pork tacos and I got steak instead.  I'm not a huge beef eater.  I never order steak when I eat Mexican.  I reserve my steak cravings for a simpler meal.  Anyway, when the dish was presented to me I looked confused and said \""""this is steak and I ordered the pork\"""" .  the server looked at me like I was lying and I just had this bummed expression on my face.  She offered to re-make it but we were short on time and I said \""""Don't worry about it.  I'll eat this\"""".  You would think she would have discounted it or something but no.  Maybe most people would have been thrilled but I was craving pork.  I probably should have argued the bill but honestly I didn't have the energy.  \n\nThe second time I stopped in (with my coworker in order to give it one more chance) I ordered the pork enchiladas and the pork was quite pink!  I didn't get sick but I was a little nervous to eat such pink pork.  \nAll in all that meal was better but I quickly became upset when I was paying the bill and got pinned in between the cashier stand and the front door when someone decided to enter the restaurant!  Yes, the front door opens inward (this is against fire code if the occupancy is 50 or more).\n\nso, there won't be a third time.....this place just rubbed me the wrong way both visits.  The food isn't bad but the environment and the servers didn't do it for me.",0,0
"Making a shot of espresso is not hard. But none of the baristas here know how to do it or they are too lazy. To make a proper shot, the coffee grounds must be firmly compressed. This requires the barista to fill, then tap, then fill again, and tap again. If this is not done, the espresso gets burnt. If you are drinking a sugary coffee drink, this may not bother you.\n\nAs a whole, the drip coffee is usually just ok. But lately it has started to tasted really burnt. Might I suggest cleaning with vinegar.\n\nThe service is hit or miss.",0,0
"Very good buffet. Tied with Bellagio in my book for best on the strip. The food is very 'saucy' and that sauce tends to be very similar - it's still buffet food afterall. It's also kinda' cute with it's little village inside and their attempt to make regional foods under the region signs (ok, not authentic at all but still). \n\nI am tempted to give it just 3 stars for the horrible lines that normally await you there. Definitely try for an off time and a bit of luck...",1,1
"With all the hype, I wanted to go see and taste the food for myself. I ordered quick since there was a menu taped to the window outside as i waited 20 minutes.

"This location never really disappoints. The waitstaff is friendly, a manager always asks how things are. I stick with Outback because the food is consistently delicious. \n\nToday I ordered an 8 oz filet, classic cooked, medium. When my steak came out it was...just not what I pictured it normally looking like. It didn't have the dark crusty seared outside. It was thin. It was cooked about medium well/close to well, and probably due to this it was tough. The texture was the worst part because I get the filet for the texture. Despite the fact that it's not usually the MOST flavorful cut, it's worth the sliiiiiight loss in flavor for the tenderness. The classic seasoning & sort of crunchy seared outside completely makes up for the lack of flavor compared with other cuts. \n\nI am NOT the type of person who sends things back, however, my boyfriend confirmed my concerns by telling me that he didn't think it looked like a filet. So, when Andrew the manager came by and asked how things were, I quizzed him about what cut he thought it was. He got it right...8 oz filet. I told him I only asked because it wasn't what I was used to a filet looking/feeling/tasting like. He agreed that it wasn't ideal and insisted on getting me a new one. I told him it wasn't necessary, and if it was the filet I'd eat it despite the lack of the usual Outback perfection. Nope...Andrew wouldn't have that. He brought a new one. The new one was undercooked, but since Andrew waited to see the inside before leaving it with me, he promptly took it back to be fixed.  \n\nThis time it was PERFECT. It was thick like a filet should be, and was cooked exactly medium...red in the center but not bloody. The searing was precisely what I always look forward to at Outback. It was the best steak I've had in a long time.\n\nI was very happy with the way Andrew and our server Shelby made me feel like a valued guest and made me feel like it was OKAY to let them make my order perfect. I don't think I'll become one of those picky sender backer types, but it was nice to know that at this Outback location I don't ever have to settle for anything less than perfect. \n\nBetween Andrew and Shelby, this location has secured me as a customer and I will be back next time I want a fantastic steak!",1,1
"A warm homey place, nice owner. Food was well prepared. Not a wide variety of pastas, in fact, the menu was verbally told to me by the owner/ chef. Overall, a good experience.",1,1
"Summary:  Spago is a great place to take a significant other.  The noise level in the cafe was not too loud which made it an enjoyable experience.  Although unnerving while watching you dine, the wait staff does a great job of answering questions and clearing dishes from the table.  The pizzas are highly recommended but be willing to shell out some money for the drinks, cocktails and wines being the most unreasonably priced.\n\nI went to Spago on New Year's Eve with my girlfriend.  Fortunately I made reservations the week before.  Our reservation was for 7:15 but I showed up a little early and was seated by 7:05.  There are two menus you can choose from; the cafe menu of the dining room menu.  The dining room menu has your meats and fine dining while the cafe menu has brick oven pizzas ad the like.  We opted for the cafe menu and ordered drinks, an appetizer, and our main meal all at once.  Unfortunately they all came out at the same time (very quickly, about 20 minutes after ordering) so our pizzas got cool while we ate our calamari.\n\nThe cafe, although mostly open to the Forum Shops street mall, was not as loud as you might expect.  Conversation was easily audible.  The wait staff was friendly and had no trouble answering any of the questions I had about the menu.  It is a little unnerving however since the wait staff lines along the side wall when they are not helping diners, observing the dining room and seeing if any diners need them.  They just stand there...looking...watching....constantly vigilant.  That aside, they do great at being Johnny on the spot for clearing dishes and helping with questing.\n\nThe calamari served with their sweet chili sauce was fantastic.  The chicken sausage pizza was equally fantastic and was a fairly large portion that I almost did not finish because it made me full.  The drink prices were the most unreasonable and unpleasant thing I encountered at Spago.  Soda is $4.50 and the cocktails range from $10-17.  I ordered a Vesper and it was $16, where a fair price could have been $9 or $10.",1,0
"I really like this place. The decor is chic, good service, and delicious food. I had my first burrata here and oh my, I can't get enough of it. I especially like the penne with mushroom dish, as well as the classic margherita pizza. \n\nOverall, I would definitely come back.",1,1
"The two stars are for Vinnie - he's pretty funny! Most of the jokes I have heard before.. but it was still a good time and kudos to him for working seven nights a week. The reason why I couldn't give any more stars is because I felt like the \""""free\"""" tickets we received was a total ripoff. Basically we got two free tickets but they have a $16.99 one drink minimum per person. It took the waitress 40 minutes to take our drink order in a small room, and the show was only about an hour or an hour and a half. I found myself searching for the waitress the whole first half to \""""make sure I got my monies worth\"""" instead of relaxing and enjoying the show. $16.99 is pretty steep, especially since you only get one, and you can only choose from beer, wine, or well. You get those for free when you sit down in the casino! I tried to order a seven and seven (which is well in other bars) but they said no. We both ended up getting a vodka cranberry and it came in a tiny glass full of ice and bright red (i.e. no booze). So sad. AND they don't let you bring in your drinks even though you already pre-paid for one. I really could have used my wine they made me throw away outside :/.\n\nSummary: LOVED Vinnie, strongly disliked the service. In the end it really felt like we got screwed with the \""""free\"""" tickets and joke of a drink. I wouldn't recommend anyone to see this show. Maybe buy one of his dvds instead and watch it in your room with a bottle of wine!",0,0

"It's unfortunate, because I really wanted to make Banner, the health provider for my families needs.  Having said that, after seeing them for various reasons over the last year and a half, I have determined that they simply do not care.  \n\nTo be more specific, both my wife and I can sense that we are no more than just a number.  After a bad experience where I was told to wait for over 45 minutes when I was early for my appt. (as requested) they made me sit in their lobby for 30 minutes past my appt. time.  I emailed a letter expressing my displeasure w/ this on their website.  I received an email from what I believe was the Manager of the location.  I was asked to call her.  I did that and left a voicemail.  That call was never returned.  I simply asked for a call back.  \n\nThe latest two incidents helped to make our final decision.  I had an episode at home where I had chest pain and turned pale, then a few minutes later got physically ill and almost passed out.  I called to set up an appt. for a check up and to see if maybe I had had a heart issue and was told that the earliest they could see me was 22 days away.  I told my friend about this and he said, what I had thought the entire time.  That is, if something like that had happened to him and he told his physician, they would want to see him ASAP\n.  \nThe second issue I have is that my wife has endometriosis and had surgery earlier this year through Banner to remove cysts.  Not only did the surgeon not remove all the cysts, but my wife is now continuing to feel pain.  When she went back to her OBGYN at Banner, she was told that a certain drug might help.  My wife was then told that they would have to have insurance approval for this treatment.  We have a PPO plan.  My issue, is that even if our plan doesn't cover the expense, we will pay it to ease her pain.  Why should insurance be the determining factor?  Heck, we'll even prepay in 100 dollar bills if that's what it takes.  When my wife decided to seek a second opinion and needed to go back to Banner to sign off on her records release to the new physician, the nurse/assistant asked if she should still submit for that drug approval through our insurance.  This was a week after she had her appointment complaining about the pain.. So basically, they just sat on it, and did nothing while she was in pain.  They didn't even do what they said they were going to do.  This is extremely frustrating and was the final straw.  \n\nDo yourself a favor and find a better team of physicians for your family's needs.  That's what we're doing now.  A family doctor should actually care about their patients, and even though I'm sure there are some very good people that work there, there seems to definitely be a systematic flaw in how they do business and treat people.  \n\nBut hey... don't take my word for it... go check out their FB page and the bad experiences posted there... I guess we're not alone.",0,1

Combine that with nice decor and decent service and I'd say it's worth repeat trips.\n\nI've been to the other Grand Lux inside Venetian (technically, this one is the \""""other\"""" Grand Lux).

But for something that will last and is more of a quality, eye-catching addition to the room, Lamps Plus is the route to go. \n\nEvery time we've been in, the salespeople have been helpful and friendly.

"I would give this place negative stars but I'm not given that option. Actually, my preferred rating would be '1 Bulldozer', but that also is not an option, so here we go. 1 very undeserved star.\n\nWe were in town visiting a friend down the street and 4 of us stopped by here for lunch on the way to the Metro. There isn't much in the area, and this placed advertised a proprietary 'Copoli Burger' with some sort of optimism, so we thought we'd give it a try. After all, who can screw up a burger?\n\nThese guys. These guys can screw up a burger, and they can screw it up with painstaking efficiency and utter contempt. I asked about the 'Copoli sauce', which the server said was just a mixture of ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise or something like that. Since I'm a no-mayo kind of guy, I figured it wouldn't be too much to ask for just the standard ketchup/mustard on the burger. To the server it seemed like a standard no-hassle request. Awesome. I couldn't wait for this seemingly giant tasty-looking burger.\n\nWhat I received was a large burger almost spitefully slathered with mayonnaise. For some context here, there was only one other table in the place, and they already had their food., so the margin for error or confusion here is very narrow. The other burger recipient at the table received their standard burger with just a standard amount of mayonnaise. So I flag the server, who was super nice during all of this, and show her the burger. Without even looking at it she said there was no mayo on it, but I didn't even have to lift up the bun to show her this 'mysterious' white ooze coming out of it. She offers to take it back and bring me a new one. This is where things get downright offensive.\n\nThrough the corner of my eye I can see the cook (who I am pretty sure is the owner, and the father of our server) take the burger back to the counter and throw the bun in the garbage. Where is the rest of the burger? I wonder. Surely that would go in the garbage too. Nope! There he is, scraping away the mayonnaise with none other than paper towel. He is clearly oblivious that with a small restaraunt, what he is doing is visible to all the customers. Maybe he does realize it, and just doesn't care. Either way, I am brought what I am expected to believe is a new burger, and again, I didn't even have to take the bun off to ask what all the white stuff was still all over the bacon. He must have missed that with the paper towel. \n\nAt this point I refuse any further burgers and I can tell the server is pretty embarassed. The cook/owner/father at no point during all of this even attempts to make eye contact (we are like 10 feet away) or offers any glimpse of shame or even recognition of how messed up this is. I watch the rest of my friends finish eating their pepperoni pizza, which had been unexpectedly dusted in sesame seeds, and I left hungry.\n\nI'm not one for gentrification, but if someone bulldozed this place and put up a condo, I wouldn't be sad.",0,1
"I attended a happy hour party on Friday. The party includes one drink for one dollar and the rest at a discounted four dollar rate. I ordered two stoli o and sodas - but my first was significantly weaker than the second even though it was made by the same bartender. It wasn't a huge deal, but  I feel that drinks should at least be consistent. The happy hour party comes with free appetizers as well. They hand everything out to you most likely to conserve food. I felt overall the temperatures were off  but most of what I tried tasted  pretty good. \n\nThe real reason for the meh review had to do with a bus person (or manager)- I really am not sure who he was. Basically we had two or three tables pushed together because we had a large group. He kept obsessing about our seating arrangement and trying to push our chairs in. It wouldn't have been a huge deal but there were four chairs to a small table-top and we would have been packed in like sardines if we kept the table the way he clearly wanted it. Even when we said we needed a bit more room he stomped around us and was visibly agitated. We were not creating any kind of distraction and the chairs were not a hazard the way we had them, he was compulsive about them, it was really strange.\n\n\nThe instrumentals were good - and the musicians clearly had a wide-range of song knowledge.

"Was excited to try this place out with the wife for a friends birthday dinner. Atmosphere was great even for June on the patio. They had black bean tortillas and whipped butter on the tables that was delicious. Margaritas were good and that would probably wrap up all the good. \n\nNow the ugly, we were with a large party that showed up in groups. Which most service people would assume separate checks or at least ask. This wasn't a concern until the end of the evening, when our server presented 1 check and expressed dismay along with words of discouragement that it would take a while to split, very unprofessional for an upscale Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale. I believe that the management at this establishment is non existent. Servers seem to do as they please, reach over guests, place plates in front of incorrect guests. Many of the simple things that management would typically ensure that there staff is engaged in doing correctly. \n\nNow the food. Carne y Camerones (steak and shrimp) great ingredients but poor execution. The steak was overcooked as well as the shrimp and served cold. The mashed potatoes were tasty but dry and cold as well. I feel that the cooks had their timing off, maybe because of the large party or just the fact that they didn't care. The technique and the ingredients were there for a great meal but it felt thrown together and was served cold. \n\nThis restaurant could be great, they have a good menu, good drinks, great atmosphere, but the service, execution, professionalism, and passion is not there. I blame the management.",0,0

"I want to start off with saying that everytime I drove by stockyards and saw that giant bull/cow on the top of the big, plain, white building, I always imagined it being a casual steakhouse with straw or peanut shells on the ground. \n\nIt's totally not.  It is like a rich Texan's house inside.  Cow rug, leather, old cowboy photos on the wall.  So the ambiance inside is totally nice and upscale-cowboy feel.  We got sat in the main dining room and I also want to add like I felt like the place was \""""dusty\"""" I don't know why, or what made me feel this way, but \""""dusty\"""" was what I got from the place.  I ordered a half slab of ribs with garlic potatoes and a salad. Travis got a burger with fries.

At my first opportunity, I drove downtown and ordered one of their signature drinks. It was delicious and the staff are very friendly and welcoming. Drink in hand, I sat outside and caught up on some reading. There's plenty of downtown flavor in this neighborhood, think you'll enjoy it.",1,1
"I bought some frozen Indian entrees from Sunflower Market and it reminded me of the time I ate here. My boyfriend's parents were in town for Spring Break this year and I had been wanting to try this place out for quite some time, so the four of us grabbed an early dinner after watching the A's beat the White Sox.\n\nI should have known it was going to be a poor experience when we drove up and saw how \""""fancy\"""" the outside was. Our waiter was rude, and when taking our order he dropped the (empty) tray once. There were only a couple of other tables with people at them, so it was pretty loud. When our food came, the waiter dropped my plate on the table, and my food got all over the table, my shirt, and even my purse. He brought me napkins a few minutes later so I could clean up his mess, and dropped his empty tray yet again. It took him forever to bring us the bill, or extra Naan, or anything we ordered. Each time we waited, I looked over at the bar and he was just standing around drumming his fingers.\n\nThe food was very bland. Even with a ton of heat/spice, the blandness overpowered everything. My boyfriend's mom is not picky at all, but she could not eat her food. \n\nThe only reason I'd even give this place one star is the mango Lassi was delicious, the naan was good, and my boyfriend and his father really enjoyed their huge Taj Mahal's.",0,0

"UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES HIRE THIS COMPANY! \n\nWORST MOVING EXPERIENCE POSSIBLE!!!!! \n\nABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!

I kept calling and calling and finally someone called me back saying they'd be there at 7PM instead of 7AM ruining my entire day of moving. \n\nTo make matters worse they were lazy, threw my belongings around, and put everything right inside the door instead of in the appropriate rooms (ALL BOXES were labeled). \n\nOh and it gets even worse because they were smoking cigs and talking/hanging out on the clock and then stopped 40 minutes early and still charged me for the entire time!!!\n\nMOST IMPORTANTLY!!!!\nThe icing on the cake was that they couldn't work pay pal so wanted me to give them my debit card number over the phone to their boss before they would leave....

"I know, a ton of reviews of this place but i find it interesting that people either seem to love it or really just don't get it. It sort of reminds me of when pulp fiction came out and you either thought it was a masterpiece (I did) or just didn't get it. So maybe Casey Moore's is the dining equivalent of pulp fiction. It certainly has that sort of gritty feel to it. However, after my last lunch review I have found myself going back for lunch several times and even for a nosh on an early Sunday evening and...it is all good. On Sunday my friend ordered the curry chicken soup and it was like...wow, everything you would expect out of a curry soup and perfect with a nice salad. At lunch the service continues to be good and the food not only reasonable but it continues to taste great.\n\nNow, I do understand that it has a bit of a different ambiance when it is busier but that that has a certain charm as well though when I really want to enjoy a good beer I find myself wondering over to Taste of Tops to experience one of their ever changing micro-brews. However, for a nice lunch in a dark bar, or hanging out at a happy hour at the end of a week with some friends, it is great for that as well.\n\nAs for the four stars..I will admit, service can be a bit slow but people...learn to catch the eye of your server! Consider it a wonderful opportunity for some training in dining assertiveness and then just enjoy the vibe.",1,1
"Went with a large group for a bachelorette party but was seated right away and had good service throughout the night.  The bread and butter was delicious!  I love when the bread seems fresh and it comes in a loaf where you can rip it off and spread the home-made butter all over that.\n\nThe steak frites is what they're know for and the meat was VERY TENDER.  Delish.  However, mine was a bit salty.  The pomme frites that come with it are more like potato chips than fries.  Three of us shared the green beans and they were a welcome vegetable amongst the carbs and protein.  It was large enough to share comfortably.\n\nGood ambiance.  Overall a nice place for dinner.",1,1
John sold me a transmission with a year warranty and it broke and he told me I broke it so it wasn't under warranty..... What the hell is a warranty for exactly??

"I will rarely take the time to complain about service, but this place is terrible. We sat for 10 or more minutes until we were acknowledged, not by our server, but a manager. Then maybe five minutes later (I am being fair here) a server brought our drinks  we ordered from the manager and almost walked away without taking our order. Furthermore, there was no apology for our 15 minute wait just to get our drinks. Mind you it wasn't even that busy. None of the servers smiled, the margaritas were not great and were mostly mix, and the food was way over priced. I got two tiny bland fish tacos for $12. If you're looking for good service and good Mexican food, I recommend going somewhere else. Otherwise, by all means don't say you weren't warned.",0,1
When we arrived we were told the wait would be 15-20mins then after 20mins we were called to be seated but the host told us he could not seat us until the 3rd person arrived so we would have to go back on the list and wait again once the 3rd person arrived - I have never heard of such a policy since we were ready to order all of the food -all ready have the 3rd persons order. We walked out and went to Mimi's where they sat us right away and served us coffee while we waited. Last time I was at Babystacks they messed up our order and we waited 20 mins for them to bring us the correct food and it was cold. Will not be going again.,0,0
"So very, very good. The steaks are excellent, and the Grade 7 Wagyu beef ribeye was worth the $105 pricetag if you truly love meat the way that I do. The sides are also fabulous - butternut squash, kale with pine nuts and white beans, french fries and chanterelle mushrooms were all yum yum yum. Somehow, I took down my 14-ounce steak and all of these sides without a problem, even after enjoying three of the deliciously buttery, salty dinner rolls. The key, I have decided is not to waste your time on starters or dessert. My table skipped the former, but we got suckered into dessert (mostly because we really wanted it)...and that was a bit of a disappointment. The Chocolate Ganache was too bittersweet (even if that is your preference, as it is mine) and dry, and the Cinnamon Monkey Bread was good, but not enough to stand on its own.\n\nService was well-guided, though they have a tendency to want to clear the plates before you're done - annoying. And one server in particular didn't listen all that well...you know when you can just tell somebody is rushing to finish your sentence or answer the question you haven't yet finished asking? \n\nBut all in all, a very good dining experience. Note: I would be pissed if I was not seated in the actual restaurant (which is huge), but rather, the bar area or outside in the mall. Hopefully, they reserve these less desirable seats for those who have not made reservations?",1,0
"The Summer Time Roll is a deliciously refreshing roll and the highlight of the evening. The Godzilla Roll is super chunky so bring a big mouthed companion with you and it is big in price, too. I would pass on the Crab Roll. Salmon nigiri tasted fresh and the portions were reasonable.  The Karatumba sake was good, as well. \n\nSo why the two stars? Mostly it was based on service and the fact that Uni was not present (just like many other sushi restaurants in town). It took well over 5 minutes after being seated for the server to come around and introduce herself and take our drink order.  It was not a busy night.  \n\nThroughout the whole evening our server only took one empty dish back to the kitchen.  I am fully aware that in some restaurants there are \""""servers\"""" and there are \""""bussers\"""" but I think servers should communicate with their bussers if the servers are less inclined to bus their own tables.  I understand that some servers want their bussers to work for their tips if the servers are \""""tipping them out.\""""  We were left with empty plates at our dinner table for the whole evening.  Our server constantly asked us if we needed more to drink and we might have been more inclined to stay and order more drinks if our table had been bussed.   \n\nEarlier at throughout the dinner, when we asked for soy sauce she grabbed the soy sauce container from an unbussed table that was dripping sloppily with sauce on the outside of the container. Later, because she chose an easy solution, we quickly ran out of soy sauce and she actually had to go inside the kitchen and bring us a filled, clean container. Overall, the impression we received is that of a lazy server.\n\nWe most likely will not go to Stingray again unless it is for a quick bite of a Summertime Roll.",0,0

Okay, so it's located at the end of the strip and the surroundings take a decided turn for the worse about one intersection away.  I expected this so it wasn't a big deal, but I was worried about my gf's impression as this was her first Vegas trip.  \n\nWe arrived about 10:30 pm.  The self-service lot is a lot less sketchy than some of the others we ended up using; I had no concerns parking.  Check in was painfully slow, and we were plagued by foreign tourists that had very different attitudes re: private space.  I was feeling pretty violated by the time another employee arrived.  They did not have the room I'd reserved (and prepaid for), so we were given the only other alternative, which was two queen beds and a beautiful view of the tower (and casino roof).  The room was otherwise nice enough, except that the curtains were broken and we were only able to draw the blackout curtain halfway.  \n\nI was very impressed with the professionalism and helpfulness of the staff.  However, if you're a couple and someone from the staff approaches you and asks if you're married, be prepared for a sales pitch.  This happened a few times by the escalators/Starbucks area.  Annoying. \n\nIt takes a long, long time to collect jackpots at the slots, and the entire time you're left sitting at the machine with little explanation...you can't even use the machine until it's reset.  But I'm not complaining too much...I was very happy that I managed to win that much.  \n\nWe ended up giving a lot of that money back, but we had a very, very good time.

"The Mr. and Mrs. have eaten at the McC & Schm in Bridgewater, NJ, with family.  The Mr. enjoyed his meal at that locale.  The Mrs. does not remember what she ate, but probably nothing memorable or out of the ordinary.\nRecently when the Mrs. accompanied colleagues to an early lunch at this McC & Schm on South Tryon Street in Charlotte, NC, she was expecting nothing out of the ordinary again.\nThe Mrs. wanted a meal without any fish or meat, but there were no enticing vegetarian offerings.  So she asked the very nice server if she could have the salmon rigatoni ($14) minus the salmon.  The accommodation could be made.  Nice.\nThe bowl of rigatoni contained small pieces of asparagus stalks and mushroom shreds. a tiny bit of artichoke, and a very liquid pesto cream sauce (not very pesto-ey tasting).  No problem.  It was more important to enjoy this lunch with the colleagues.\nThe Mrs. ate only half the bowl of soupy rigatoni, then the nice server boxed up the other half to take back to the office and finish later.\nThe surprise came when the bill arrived.  There was no price reduction for leaving out the salmon from the dish.  It was full price, without the top-billed salmon.  The server informed no accommodation could be made on the price.  The total bill, including tax and very nice tip, came out to $19.\nUpon returning to the office, the Mrs.' very sensitive stomach was unhappy; perhaps it was the cream sauce.  She threw out the uneaten boxed half of this meal.\nThis lunch of half a bowl of meatless/fishless pasta wound up costing $19.  Way too expensive for an adult-focused fast-food chain-restaurant.\nThe service was nice, the food not so much.

"Hectors is absolutely my most frequented, and most favoured public house establishment in Stockbridge, and it's pretty high up there when it comes to the whole of Edinburgh actually.\n\nI've been coming here for what must be a good few years now, and it's one of these places that when in doubt, or if you're feeling indecisive, you can always just plump for Hectors, because you know it'll be great banter.\n\nHectors very much seems like a locals' pub when you arrive through its big doorway, as its deep, comfy sofas, welcoming looking and spacious interior all promote a feeling of sinking yourself down and chatting away with a few beers for hours. Hectors is brilliant because I think it's achieved that nice happy medium between chilled out pub and stylish bar. You can feel a bit of both here, whether you're slouching about on a Sunday afternoon and winding down the weekend, or you're here on a Friday for some pre party time drinking. \n\nIt's pretty much always busy in Hectors in the evening, so there is a chance you'll have to wait a while to get a seat, but you can always prop up the bar and observe until you see a space. The best spot to get if you're in a big group is right up the back of the bar, where there are two sofas, a fireplace and other bits of seating. When you're occupying that whole space, it kind of feels like you have your own wee private area.\n\nThe bar has a very decent wine and general beverages range, plus it does a lunch and dinner menu throughout the week, which changes at the weekend. If I'm to be totally honest, the food can be hit and miss, but when it's good, it's good, and it mostly seems to be at super busy weekend times that standards seem to drop a bit.\n\nAll in all, I love Hector's fairy light draped bar and general vibe, which regularly draw me in for drinking happiness and japery.",1,1

"I have previously had some mediocre experiences here before, but my wife likes this place, so I decided to give it another try--again to my disappointment.  Upon sitting down at the sushi bar, we placed our drink and appetizer orders right away with our server.  After about ten minutes, I made eye contact with our server chatting away at the greeter stand.  When she came over, I reminded her that I still had not received my Asahi and Sake and with wide eyes she told me it was 'coming right out' as if she had not forgotten, but that apparently opening a bottle of beer takes ten minutes.\n\nAfter I finally got my drinks, we placed our sushi order with the sushi chef.  After another fifteen minutes passed, we received our sushi--an order of two rolls and two orders of nigiri.  The timing of the sushi order was fine, but the chef explained that they had run out of octopus, so he would not be able to make one of my nigiri orders.  We still had not received our appetizers--an order of edamame and an order of pot-stickers.  I again made eye contact with our server (again chatting at the greet stand).  When she came over, I asked about our appetizers--she told us that hot food usually takes longer than the sushi to make.  First of all, we're talking edamame and pot-stickers!  Those should take 5 minutes max.  Secondly, we ordered them as 'appetizers'--you know, those things that come 'before' the meal?  Thirdly, we had now waited 25 minutes for them.  I am a restaurant manager and have 20 years of service industry experience.  I cannot handle when servers begin making excuses for the fact that they forgot our order. Mistakes sometimes happen, excuses should not.\n\nIn addition, my beer and sake glasses were both dirty, my sushi was poorly executed, the nigiri not fresh, and our green tea ice cream was freezerburnt.  If you have not dined here, please spare yourself the experience I payed for today.  Go to Stingray, Pearl, or Blue Wasabi.  Do not waste your money here.  I certainly never will again.",0,0
"Came here on a 4 day 3 night package deal that was incredibly affordable with the mandatory Timeshare Presentation\n\nSix of us got a banging two-bedroom suite equipped with Jacuzzi, washer/dryer, projector, full-sized kitchen, king-sized beds, and a decent view - We were on the 14th floor facing an empty parking lot but still, we weren't in the hotel room for most of the trip.\n\nPros: \n-BEST deal ever.

"I summoned my inner nerd and ventured out to the biodome which was one of the checkpoints I wanted to hit up on my first trip to Montreal. I came at a perfect time (which was near closing) because I was able to enjoy the exotic animals without having to push little bratty kids out of the way. As far as the exhibits, it was put together in a engaging informative way. From bats to alligators, piranhas to porcupines the staff does a good job of showcasing the creatures in relations to their ecosystems. On the downside, it was a bummer because not all of the animals were present. Go check it out, it's worth going.",1,1

"Oh my God. Okay so we had no intention to go here but we were in Planet Hollywood for a comedy show on a Sunday night. We were approached by a man and he told us to check it out for free entry and one complimentary drink. We thought why not. So we go in to get our drink and the bartender said no free drink and was so rude about it, it was shocking. He wouldn't even look at us, just kept acting snotty and shaking his head no. It was the weirdest thing. Our wristbands even said one complimentary drink right on it and we showed him but he just kept saying no, without an explanation of why or anything. So odd and rude. Anyway I told the door man of the issue and he said we had to get a drink ticket and he radioed down and talks with someone and then says to me that he was sorry but since it was slow they were not doing it! WTF?? wow.\n\nWe decided to stay anyway and purchase a drink. Again, rudest treatment ever from that bartender. I think the receipt said his name was Humberto or something like that. He still would not even look at us and just had a mean expression on his face. Worst treatment I have ever had!. Not one smile, not one hello, not even one word spoken to us or even acknowledgment. We left that area and went by the dance floor and it was pretty dead. However it started picking up as the night went on. Still not busy by night club standards, but it was a Sunday that might be why. \n\nEvery time we would set our drink down it would disappear!  Seriously someone kept cleaning away our full drinks if they were even left for a second (not alone, there was a group of us) or if we even turned our back at all, bam drink was gone. At $12 a drink, that was extremely upsetting, and again, weird!\n\nTerrible service. The employees in this establishment will be it's downfall.",0,0
"Comme Ca has the best value meal I've found in Vegas. $22 for a 3 course meal? I don't think it gets better than this! I got the french onion soup, the mussels, and the creme brulee. The french onion soup is fantastic. The soup itself is rich with sauteed onion and bread that has soaked in all the flavor of the broth. And the best part of course, is the gruyere cheese on top, especially the crusty parts. I'm really not doing it enough justice by describing it. \n\nThe mussels are good (but not as good as the soup, ha). I love that they present it in the cast iron pot. Comme Ca's mussels come with whole roasted garlic and sausage. I love the garlic (it's been cooked long enough to be super sweet) but not the sausage so much. It gives it a meaty and heavy taste, and I'd prefer it to be lighter. (My favorite mussels, BTW, is Bouchon or ACote in Berkeley). All in all though, it's still a decent main course.\n\nI'm usually not a fan of desserts, but I love creme brulee and Comme Ca makes a solid one. You can see the bits of vanilla bean in every bite of custard, and the hard caramel is caramelized perfectly. I also had a bite of the pot de creme (orange was the flavor of the day) and it's a light, clean, and refreshing dessert.\n\nAll in all, it is really a bang for your buck kind of meal. I've also tried a couple things on the regular meal, and I really liked the oxtail benedict (oxtail is very tender and it's a solid eggs benedict) and the duck and pork belly \""""cinnamon\"""" roll (sweet and savory dish that is very interesting). The only dish I haven't been a fan of is the beef tongue hash (not all that spectacular). Service was great (it was a very slow Saturday lunch for them), and another plus is that it has a great view of the Strip if you want to take some photos.",1,1

"Centered between my school, office and house, Copper Star Coffee offers a cozy and versatile environment perfect for doing homework, meeting up with a friend, or simply staring out the window and contemplating life.\nThe variety of hot teas they offer is rather good, as is their hot drip coffee. If you ever get the chance to try their peach blackberry muffin, please do so. It's unlike any muffin I've ever had before.\nThe only downside is parking. They have a parking lot with two spaces plus one handicap space.

"THE GOOD:\n\n-Walkable distance from most of the main downtown hotel casinos & just a block away from Bonneville Transit Center if you want to bus it from The Strip. \n\n-Interesting menu variety that has something for everyone. So much so that it makes you want to try everything on the menu.\n\n-Was not crowded on a weekday which was when I visited. Very odd for a place with such high review marks.\n\n-Server was very courteous and friendly.\n\nTHE BAD:\n\n-While walkable if coming from the direction of The Plaza Hotel along Main Street, the neighborhood is very sketchy and does not feel safe even in broad daylight. And from what I can tell while riding on the SDX, even the walk from Bonneville Transit Center looks hazardous to pedestrians so you may have to walk a very long walk to avoid getting hit by cars.\n\n-I had the misfortunate experience of an apparent lost order where it was not \""""relayed\"""" to the kitchen which could mean any number of things. Waiting 35 minutes for your meal to arrive can do a number of things to your imagination. Who screwed up? It sure sounded like the server blamed it on their computer system. What the heck does \""""relayed\"""" mean? Does it mean it got punched into the system and the send button wasn't hit? Whatever. \n\n-The manager came by to apologize for the wait. Even asked me if there was something he can do for me. I'm not one to ask for anything complimentary so what can I do but shrug? Not a single piece of appeasement or discount was had or offered to make up for it so it made his apology sound insincere. Why are you asking me how to do your job? It only made me more angry and upset.\n\nTHE UGLY:\n\n-In an attempt to bring everything out at once as suggested by my server, and to add insult to injury, my grilled cheese sandwich was cold. No ways would I wait another 30 minutes for them to make a new one. In hindsight I should have asked them to remove it from my bill.\n\n-An overall horribly disappointing experience.

When I called today because I noticed that my birthday was also wrong, I decided to check to make sure the phone number had been changed and all she did was list my real number as a secondary number instead of getting rid of the imaginary number. When you are dealing with people's medical insurance it is vitally important that you get all of their information correct.

And to top it off when I called today to confirm the right birthday and make sure she changed the number she laughed at me. I personally don't find incompetence funny at all.",0,0

"DO NOT STAY UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR PERSONAL BELONGINGS STOLEN!!! I am currently on vacation here at Paris (not even here 24 hours) and someone at the pool stole my bag with my personal items such as phone, wallet with credit cards and id. Granted it was partially my fault for stepping away for two minutes; however the hotel staff and security were NOT helpful. Security simply made me fill out a report and that was the end of that. The front desk kept asking for ID in order for us to get new keys into our room in which we couldn't provide this information because it was stolen. The person who stole our things withdrew over 1000.00 from a local ATM as well as went on a shopping spree at the Nike store. Surveillance cameras were not checked and the front desk did not even allow us to use their phone to make a phone call. The front desk was quick to say that they would charge my stolen credit card the balance of the room before I decided to call my credit card company to report it stolen. My entire trip is ruined because I have no id, no money, and now I have to spend another day tomorrow tryng to find a police sub station that is open in order to file a report as well as try to get some type of report verifying my identity to travel home. \n\nEntering Paris, you will notice tons of security wandering around; however when something actually happens they are useless. Anyone is allowed to come to pool with or without a room key. It wouldn't surprise me if one of the Paris employees by the pool had somethng to do with it!",0,0
"UPDATE: after writing this review I did hear from Sarah the business manager at the Downtown Grand as well as from Choice Hotels corporate - well sort of on the latter.  Choice Hotels corporate sent me a joke of an apology letter that did nothing for me nor did it even address my situation - clearly a form letter which is rather insulting.  After playing phone tag with the Downtown Grand for a while, Sarah gave me the option of rescheduling my stay for another time up to July 2015, which is 1-year after I made the reservation.  Unfortunately that also does nothing for me, because I can't get out to Vegas by then.  \n\nSO...at the end of the day the Downtown Grand is keeping my $400+ bucks, and I'm getting nothing, which leaves my evaluation at 1-star.  Appreciate the effort from Sarah, but it doesn't go far enough.  Was really hoping for a full refund or at least a partial refund, say all but $100.  \n\nFYI - my 4 buddies that I go to Vegas with every year at this time are also incensed about this.  We usually get pizza at the Downtown Grand's pizza restaurant for lunch 1 day during our trip, and they were considering staying at the hotel this time as well.  Well, the restaurant is now off the rotation and they did not reserve their rooms at the Downtown Grand, due entirely to what happened to me.  \n\nHope the Downtown Grand's loss of a couple of thousand dollars of business from us every year was worth the $400+ of mine.",0,0

"Decide to cancel our reservation at the Aria last month and try the Mirage instead. We reached Vegas late the night of December 6th and found that we got a double bed even though we had asked for a king during reservation. A quick call to the Mlife counter and we were whisked away to another room with a king bed and a great view of the strip on one of the higher floors.\nGambling was fun at the Mirage and we spent almost 90 percent of our gambling time there. The dealers were friendly and people at the table were fun. This was our first time staying so far up north on the strip and we really liked it. Usually, we stay at Mandalay Bay which is on the southern tip of the strip or at the Aria, which is more centrally located.\nWe always make it a point to go BLT Burger regardless of where we stay on the strip and we have never been disappointed. This time was no exception either. Their burgers are awesome and I love their Knight Rider shake.\n\nWe tried out Stack for dinner one night and it was not bad at all. The ambiance is good and the food was pretty decent.\n\nOh, and the best part, Mlife comped off our entire stay when we checked out (except for my wife's spa bill), which was very nice of them. Probably their way of compensating us for all our gambling losses for the trip! :)",1,1

Andre got the ribeye with veggies instead of the traditional sides and he was very happy with it. He raved about it and told the sever how fantastic it was.

"Although the exercise and sweating is pretty awesome, there are definite issues that are hard to ignore.  First, there is nothing to help new people understand what they should wear or bring with them.  Second, the instructions for what to have in the class are non-existent.  Third, there are so many students in the class and the instructor is all over the place so new people haven't the slightest clue of what to do.  The only way I was able to do at least something was to watch the person next to me.  The instructor provided NO instruction that made sense for beginners and conducted class like everyone was a veteran.  There needs to be separate beginner classes for sure along with some material or something on their web site that explains what you need and should bring.  The instructor should have smaller classes and be cognizant of what special requirements the students need (such as carpal tunnel and alternate positions).  Very disappointed with the setup and lack of instruction.  Also, after 7pm, there is no one manning the front desk and they lock the front door so you'll have to unlock and leave yourself if you happen to leave early.  If you do happen to go, here are some tips: 1) show up 15-20 minutes early your first time for paperwork 2) bring a yoga mat, yoga mat towel, sweat towel and bottle of water 3) highly suggest sports bra of sorts for the women and only shorts (no shirt) for the men 3) wear flip flops or slip-on/off shoes 4) leave purse/valuables/stuff in the car or at home 5) if using a card for payment, get some kind of small wallet that you can clip to your yoga mat or wrist 6) inside the classroom there are no shoes allowed and little or no talking 7) the room is a long rectangle and if a lot of folks are there, be prepared to be close to your neighbor.",0,0

Then, it took a few minutes to sort it out. Now we'd wasted 15 minutes of a 30 minute lesson. This was the first lesson since we have been back where my son was back to being comfortable and attentive in the water and it was wasted on training their own staff. He was off jumping around on the platform and playing. He basically got a 10 minute lesson because they usually play with water toys the last 5min, as a reward for listening. The playing is fine. But I am not okay with spending $42 on a 10 minute lesson. I would also have preferred that they informed me of the training in advance, as I would have known there would be wasted time and then would have rescheduled my lesson....sneaky sneaky bad customer service.\n\nThe worst part? When the staff started scrambling around after we informed them about the lack of attention during our private lesson...we asked that he stop training during our lesson...the person I am assuming is a manager or owner came out of the office and once she heard what was going on, she hid in the back offices and did not say anything to us. I mean, a manager should have AT LEAST apologized on behalf of the business and the RIGHT thing to would have been to reschedule us for a new lesson. Nope, nothing.\n\nOur instructor is good, Adam, which is why we return. And we have now signed up for a bunch of lessons coming up so we will see that through. We are looking for a new school after that.",0,0
Worst Best Buy ever.\n\nI just had an employee there throw a temper tandrum because I asked him to call someone who has keys to the mobile locker over so I can buy my item.

"Terrible! \nI recently got a gel nail fill and hated it.\nThey can't do any designs, even the simplest ones.  I asked for colour tips with a small heart on my accent nail.

I ended up getting white tips with a full colour accent nail.  they use airbrush paint for white tips and got paint ALL OVER MY HANDS!\nThey didn't shape my nails properly, it was messy and when she actually used the gel colour for my accent nail, she got it all over my skin.\nI jumped from chair to chair and had to keep moving my stuff (i.e purse and shopping bags)\nMy nails also hurt for an entire day after I got them done.  \nIt was very cheap but that was the only positive thing i have to say about this place",0,1
"***DON'T*** GO TO CELEBRATE A BIRTHDAY.  I was floored! $135 in food for 4 people to celebrate my husband's B-day and they don't do anything, we would have gone to the Black Angus or CARVERS they are near the same area, just as delicious steaks *and* less money $!!  At least at those places we would get a candle in a brownie just so we could say that we had him blow out a candle for his b-day.  I can't justify $28 entries that do not come with a soup or salad in this economic climate, and NO hospitality, so even though the food is good we won't be returning because we really only go for special occasions go to Carvers or Black Angus or even Outback!

"Go figure that I would spot this place even before I got to the coffee shop that I was looking for.  After my coffee splurge I decided to come in here for a look-see.  My attention was first caught by the 20% off handbags, and I did look at a few business totes that a sales associate was most helpful with.  This surprised me because I had the impression that the staff at the store might be the snooty, but she wasn't.  They have quite a variety of brands here that include Michael Kors, Kate Spade, Juicy Couture amongst others, which I believe DSW does not carry.  The sales aren't as great.  I did get 30% off a pair of Charles David shoes here, and many of the shoes don't come with shoe boxes.

"My first visit to Yoga Sanctuary East Side location was an expectation of a better studio than the West side. I came for Shawn's 2nd series of Ashstanga practice on a Saturday. The class was amazing! \n\nBack to the studio, a friend mentioned east side studio is a lot better than west side.  It is located inside a 2 story building/shopping center. I had to take the elevators or stairs to the studio. As I waited in the lobby for the class to start, it felt that I was more in an office environment rather than in a studio so I was disappointed.  Once I walked into the room where the class is held, it was definitely better! 2 huge windows and you can see the vigorous and mountainous desert oasis.

"DON'T GO HERE IF YOU ARE ATTENDING A SHOW THAT NIGHT!!!!  We had been in contact many times before the day of our reservation with the restaurant, letting them know we were attending Phantom of the Opera (which shows in the Venetian, so close by the restaurant) that evening.  We were originally not even going to eat here becuase we thought it may be too much of a time crunch, but were talked in to it by the hostess on the phone, so we consented and made a reservation.  So multiple times they had it in their notes that we had to get out in time for the show.  Then night of reservation, we let the hostess know again on our way in that we were seeing the show later and also let our server know.  And unfortunately, we ended up missing our show, and out over $500 in show tickets, on top of over $600 we just spent on dinner there.  So a +$1,000 evening ruined and frankly wasted!!!  I've been trying to get the manager to call me back to see about getting some kind of compensation as the restaurant caused us to miss the show, and they will just not be considerate and get back to me.  I talked to him once, night of after the fiasco happened and he said he would \""""assess\"""" the situation and get back to me, and has yet to do so, and we've tried calling him 4 times since, and no return phone call each time because he's \""""too busy.\""""  So my recommendation, if you want a nice meal out (like we did) before seeing the show, go elsewhere!  **If you see this CUT, it'd be nice to get a call back and get something figured out...I'd be more apt to leave you a better review!**",0,1

"It had been over a year since I last visited this restaurant. I should have waited even longer. The place was empty which should have been an indication of how the food has changed - not for the better. 2 of us ordered the Gyros salad. How hard can that be to make? Gyro meat, lettuce, onions, 1 tomato slice and sauce. Unfortunately for us, apparently it was hard to do.  Because they seem to do little business, the lettuce was turning brown on some pieces. And the gyros meat had been on the spit a little too long. Pieces of it were crisp and hard to chew.  The meat really had no taste to it either. I won't be back. And from the looks of it, neither will many others.",0,0

"If you were to base 7 Cees as a restaurant it definitely will get one star.   However this place is known as a grease spoon dive.  That is exactly what it is and by far the very best dive diner that I have ever been too.        \n\n Jeanie is great.  She will be your greeter, your hostess, your waitresses, your personal cook, your bus person, and your cashier.  whew!!!!  Jeanie is not a jeannie in a bottle. She cannot snap her fingers so that your meal magically will appear in front of you.  She is the only person that I have ever seen working in there and you will definitely need time to wait and wait for your food.\n\n Her cooking area is quite small.  Trust me you do not want to question her about where your meal is or how much longer it will take for you to get it.   Jeanie does swear like a sailor, but in a quiet mild manner and NOT like a raging lunatic.  When you come here you will have to except every swear word constantly flowing from her mouth.    Trust me I  hate it with a passion when people swear, but with Jeanie, it is okay.\n\n But with Jeanie, you have to know it is coming and it will be coming in full force.  However while Jeanie will swear like a sailor she greets everybody with a kind and sweet heart.  She will make your order the way you want it.  Beware!!!!!  The portions are huge!!!!!   The coffee is endless. The prices are very reasonable. \n\n So why only four stars when it should really be a five.  Well as I mention Jeanie's swearing like a sailor is part of the 7 Cees experience.

Both were delicious and well-seasoned. It was creamy and not overly salty. The English muffin was nicely grilled. I loved the fact that they gave us lots of hollandaise sauce. One disappointment was the eggs were overpoached. Eggs benedict should be runny, but the yolk almost cooked all the way through. The hotcakes were hot, huge and fluffy. Service was great and helpful for our needs to be quick. Overall, pretty delicious breakfast food.",1,1

"Time2tint had an Amazon local special that I purchased.  When I called to get my car done they claimed they had no appts available for 3 weeks when I was available to have it done.  I decided I would leave work, or do what I needed to do, in order to get the job done prior to the heat of the summer.  When I called to schedule the next available appt I was told they had nothing available at all until June 4.  About an hour later a friend of mine called to see if they could tint his car.  Dan answered the phone, asked where my friend got the number to this company, and scheduled him an appointment the NEXT DAY, for a full price tint job.\n\nI was able to get my car tinted that day, May 12, at a reputable business for less than the price of Time2tint's special offer.\n\nNeedless to say, I will not be doing business with them and I will be certain to let as many people as I can know how this company does business.

"OK so DON'T go here... it's that easy!!! There were so many things wrong with my dining experience it's hard to even figure out where to begin!\n\n1) SERVICE-- I went on a Sunday evening and sat at the bar so I could watch football. The poor bartender does everything here.  She had 9 people at the bar, was cleaning glasses, answering the phone,getting our food  AND she has to make all the drinks for the waiters. And when I say ALL the drinks, they come up to her for a COKE, they don't even have a fountain drink machine for the waiters to do it themselves.  Needless to say, it took her a while to get my food ordered. There also was a group of 3 guys that sat next to me that were ordering food and playing video poker too [hold that thought].\n\n2) DRINKS--They have video poker at the bar. Fine by me. THEY DON'T COMP your DRINKS at the bar. Unheard of in Vegas. I lost $40 bucks and still paid FULL price for my 2 glasses of wine.\n\n3) FOOD--Bread? They have bread here???? Based on the other reviews apparently they do. We didn't' see any bread at the bar- carb free for us! My meal came out before my salad. Noooo bueno.  Also, about 25 mins after I ordered my meal arrived. WHY so long you ask? Because the bartender has to leave the BAR and go get the food herself. I have never in my life seen a restaurant where the bartender goes and gets her own food.  The reasoning for my salad coming out late, the waiters were getting there before her, and since the Caesars are made to order I lucked out.  Let's talk about the food...I order the combination meal-petite fillet, salad, veggie, & shrimp scampi to the tune of $65. \n\nOutback has better steak then this place. It was really dry [see pix] there wasn't even any juice on the plate. When I think of shrimp scampi-garlic, white wine, shrimp, butter, and parsley comes to mind.  This was NOT that.  It was gelatinous kinda like shark fin soup & the tails were still on the 5 shrimp.  Side of broccoli extremely undercooked. It needed 2 or 3 more minutes in the microwave from where it came from.\n\nGuys next to me started laughing when my food arrived. Then I one upped them told them I bet their apps come out with their food....well I was sort of right. Their food came out, but there were no apps with it. So poor little bartender, now has to leave the bar, for about the 5th time [with 9 people at it PS-it only seats 12] and once again go get our food. \n\nPS- I complained about the order in which the food came out, hostess did come talk to me [she might have been the manager] instead of apologizing, offering me a dessert, taking off a glass of wine, she told the bartender if she starts to get behind let her know and she'll help out.  I mentioned to her too the same thing happened to the guys next to me. She offered no apologies and didn't even go speak with them.\n\nMind you we are drinking, eating, AND playing at this place.  My meal cost me well over $125 and was worth about $30 in my opinion.\n\nAgain STK or Botero are much better options. I also have no idea how anyone else had a GOOD experience here as this might be the worst experience I've had in Vegas and maybe in a restaurant period.",0,0
"A few weeks ago I started a topic about Laser Eye Surgery in the Valley because I had no clue where to start. I got a lot of feedback (Thanks Yelpers!), it was all fantastic, but I chose Bob B.'s recommendation of Jay Schwartz in the end because of credibility. Seeing that he is the team ophthalmologist for the Suns, Diamondbacks and Coyotes - I was immediately sold. I called for an appointment and was immediately scheduled and even mailed a packet of information with pricing and forms to fill out prior to my visit. I was already being educated before walking in the door.\n\nThe consultation for Lasik eligibility was free. And we're not talking a quick in-n-out sales technique. I spent almost 2 hours being informed even further about the procedure and then going through a series of vision tests with not one...not two...but 3 experts (2 Doctors) - the final tests being performed by Dr. Jay Schwartz himself.\n\nI had many questions and each of them were answered clearly, in depth and with genuine care. I was never left alone for longer than a few minutes at which time I was comforted by the signed Marion jersey on the wall. I don't even watch sports, but the entire office has jerseys from our lovely Phoenix sports teams and I'll admit it was pretty reassuring. \n\nI never felt pressured at any time during my visit either. In fact, it was quite the opposite and I had to ask to make an appointment to schedule the procedure. So next week, I will be going in for the surgery and I'll be able to see.

I couldn't believe I was eating a slice of fatty tuna- it really Yates like a5 wagyu!! The rolls were good too, the koi crispy rice was very flavorful though I wish thee was less rice and more spicy tuna. But maybe because the tuna was spicier than average that's why they ratioed the rice and tuna that way. Also try the hamachi fusion with truffles and citrus oil.

"I want to give Prive a better review, really I do.  2 1/2 stars is really what they deserve, but they could be so much better.  i see that a lot of other people really have positive reviews about this place, and its not that i hate it. it just has some major issues, especially if you are not blessed with the $$ or the people required to get a table.  being as i usually travel alone, my problem is the latter.\n\nthe herd of people clustered around the escalator is always a major pain in the ass.  i've had two very different experiences in this regard 1)was by myself and on guestlist, got in right away 2)was with my cousin and on guestlist, but she was already pissed due to the amount of people waiting to talk to the bouncer.  so she gave him major 'tude from jump and we basically had to force him to let us in.  over an hour later.  so the moral is: be nice, and look right.\n\nonce you get in though, the club is okay but vegas standards.  no blatantly obvious theme or decor, just a big room.  now, i've never found or hung out in any other area than the main room - i don't even know where the other areas are actually (there's a patio?).  but the main room is decent, and this is why this place has potential.  once in, it is generally fun, music is pretty good and the crowd is good.  but, like another reviewer mentioned, there's not a particular vibe or spirit to this place.  to me, its just another big generic club.  it just happens to have go go dancers and high drinks.  and these days you really can get that anywhere.\n\nnow, this place also has potential because when they have a special guest host or DJ, they usually deliver and its usually pretty good.  i was here when DJ Clue and Lil Jon were here, and both nights i had a good time shakin it.  now i'm not one to risk it, but my cousin danced so hard she had to ditch the shoes, so that is evidence of how decent a time we had.\n\nlike i said, drinks are somewhat expensive, i think 4 rum & cokes was like $50 once you added in a tip.  but thats to be expected.  so drink before you go (to any vegas club, really).  \n\ni will go to prive again, because like i said its not all bad.  but if i have to deal with that jerk with the too short pants and funny hair at the entrance again, it will be on.....",0,1
"I have to admit that I had no idea who Holly Madison was before seeing this show, but I had some clients who were dying to see it, so I bought the best seats that were still available which weren't VIP, but the next section up.  The seats were good even though they were one of the front rows on the second level.  \n\nThe dancing and choreography was ok, the singing was good, but I agree with all the other reviews that Holly was pretty much useless.  I would have thought this show was pretty good if I had seen it in Atlanta, GA, but it definitely was not up to Vegas standards.  Holly showed her boobs a couple of times and strutted back and forth across the stage a few times, but other than that, the show could have gone on without her.  If seeing Holly is your only reason for wanting to see this show, then you are going to be disappointed.\n\nOh, and the whole nursery rhyme theme with the boobs just didn't go together.  It was actually kind of creepy.  \n\nThe \""""audience\"""" member, Timber, was very talented.  He was a great actor and was pretty convincing as an audience member.  Then he did some rope tricks in the bathtub scene...that was cool.\n\nThe girl in green who plays Ms. Pete pretty much made me turn gay for about 6 minutes.  She was awesome.  (Although the third little piggy who danced to Brickhouse might have made me turn a little gay too.)\n\n\nAnd lest I forget, the milk scene was cool.  I will give them that.\n\nIt wasn't horrible...I was just disappointed in it for $111/ticket.  For $50/ticket it might have gotten a higher rating because my expectations would have been lower.

That morning I got to the Southwest checkin counter and was shocked to see my connection was at 1:10 -- my flight was at 12:10, literally in Iike 20 minutes.  I crawled up and surrendered hopelessly, expecting due reprimand, scolding and punishment.  But the agent at the desk said with an encouraging smile \""""I think if you run you can make it!\"""".  So off I ran. Just as I got to the gate they were boarding.  Another airline would have just said no.  The biggest shock of all was seeing my bag on the carousel safe and sound. I love Southwest and their awesome team!",1,1
It's just kinda ok. Drinks aren't that great. I mean stick to beer. A bartender can't mess up a beer. Mixed drinks were weak. Seemed like the place was too busy for on hands to deal with. Mixed drinks are too pricey for what u get. It's not good Mexican food either. Its just ok Americanized Mexican food. When u walk into a Mexican restaurant and the lady working there gives u attitude cuz she needs to serve you during her novelas that's a Mexican restaurant.  But its locations cool. There's just too many places too eat in Vegas. Not worth it bros.,0,0
"I learned so much about hair today!  When I went in, my hair looked like absolute crap.  I'd had a bad experience letting a new person cut my hair, so I was extremely anxious about this appointment.  But I can say with certainty that I have never sat in the chair of a hair stylist who knows more about hair.  Kelly Z  really knows her shit.  She took the nastiest, botched up cut and made it awesome.  The things she taught me may be common knowledge to everyone else, but I am utterly incompetent when it comes to hair.  I had no idea that by washing my hair every day, I was stripping all the moisture from my hair and combined with this dry Wisconsin winter (something I know nothing about, having spent 22 years in the south), I had created so much static electricity that I couldn't flip a light switch without getting shocked!  Anyway, I'm incredibly happy with my haircut; Kelly Z did an amazing job with everything.  Also, Rosa gave me the best eyebrow wax I've ever had.  No slapping on some hot wax and ripping out your hair.  This girl takes her time and does a thorough job.  I could barely even feel when she pulled off the strips.  Thank you so much, ladies!!",1,1
"First time here and it was like Denny's meets fine dining.\n \nThis isn't an \""""eaters\"""" paradise, small pricey portions and in my opinion the food was just ok.\n\nThis will never be a place of choice for me!",0,1
"To give it two stars is being generous.  I don't even feel like reviewing this place.  The only reason we had so much fun being here is because we ignored all the negative stuff and just climbed.\n\nI'll just make this brief.\n\n1.)  It smells like socks and dirty shoes.  The ventilation is not very good and if you're there for hours, maybe you'll just get used to the stench.\n\n2.)  The receptionist was not helpful, condescending, and acted like helping us was too much out of the way.  Probably just got used to regulars and is very nice to them.  But to newbies, forget it.  My cousin is the nicest guy you could ever meet and will even go out of his way to buy food for the poor.  He just wasn't worth the time to be given good service to I think.\n\nI think if the smell wasn't so bad and if service was better I would recommend people to come here or myself to come here to have fun.",0,1
"Went into Topshop today to return an outfit and I was told by Sara \""""the manager\"""" that my clothes were too worn. She arrived to the counter in a horrible mood and didn't even greet me with a hello or how are you or  even introduce herself as the manager. I worn them for maybe an hour and they were still in perfect condition. She then told me the extra buttons are missing but I don't know anyone that keeps the extra buttons on their outfits while they wear them. Just the week before I spent $500 on clothes there and I just needed to return one outfit but she said that she sees clothes everyday and mine are \""""wrinkly\"""" so u can't return them for me because they have a few wrinkles she said yes and that's it. She was so disrespectful and very demeaning. I said then maybe I'll try to go to a different Topshop facility so I can talk to someone with better customer service skills and she said good luck because I'm the manager and were the only Topshop in Vegas. This is apparently the only Topshop in Vegas so needless to say I won't be shopping there anymore. Sincerely, a used to be a loyal guest!",0,1
"The hubby and I were out running errands and time was flying buy, we were starving, and I have been on a constant craving for Italian subs (thanks Jersey Mikes!) so I said lets go to streets, we were in that shopping center anyway... I remembered about six years ago, a friend who worked there hooked me up with an Italian sub, and I remembered it being good. I also remembered having pizza from some other Streets location at some point and it was fresh and good also... I didn't feel very skeptical. We were sat but it seemed like we were forgotten for a while, it took like ten minutes before our waitress came (there were only two or three other tables sat, and at least four servers there). I ordered the sub, hubby ordered medium wings. They brought the complementary bread and I realized it was about to be a sucky meal. The bread was old, the marinara was nasty. I got my Caesar about another ten minutes latter, it was also nasty, the dressing was like Kraft or something bottled and low quality, there was the most powerful BO smelling red onion slice on top. The wings and sandwich didn't take as long... The wings were like precooked Tyson frozen wings with some kind of weird glaze, flavored like buffalo sauce. It didn't even look like real wings. The sandwich was soooooooooooooo gross. The bread was gross, the dressing was flavorless... I hate spending money (yeah it wasn't that much, only a $20 lunch for two, but still...) on food that is nasty. Even the water was nasty. It makes me so mad! Only good thing, our waitress was nice.  We should have went to Greek Corner, where I know the food is GOOD!  Streets needs to make their food fresh to start improving...",0,0
"Don't be fooled as you pull up to Umami. The restaurant looks like an normal house on the outside, but inside there is a small bar and about a dozen tables inside. \n\nUmami's bar has a nice selection of sake, sake mixed drinks, and a good selections of beer. It's not too big, but it's big enough to mingle and make some new friends. One thing I didn't understand is how you could not take your bar tab to your table. The bartender made me close out and pay before sitting down to order food. \n\nThe food was decent. Nothing to write home and tell everyone to fly out to Madison to try their food. The best thing we had were the steam pork buns. Pretty traditional. Nice steamed bun, with a nice slice of pork belly served with scallions, cucumbers and hoisin sauce. The dumplings weren't anything special. Tasted like frozen pot stickers from the store. We had an order of pork and shrimp, and I probably had a total of 3 whole shrimps in 4 potstickers. The ramen was decent. I'm glad we ordered the other food because this is probably the smallest bowl of ramen I've ever had. Noodles were cooked well, but I think i had two strips of bamboo shoots and half a cup of noodles. The tonkatsu soup was lacking on the pork flavor. It had a good color, but was really light on the fatty pork flavor.\n\nOverall, Umami was delicious for the area and it could be a lot worse. If I am ever back in Madison and I need a bowl of ramen, Umami is the place to go.",1,1
"I am a big fan of both the Summer Pops and Movie in the Park events here. I'm not so much of a fan of the other events (ex. Great Grapes, Bourbon, Beer & BBQ etc). In short, the park is great for picnic style festivities. It's nice to sprawl out on the blanket, enjoy the music or movie. BUT it's a nightmare for any food/drink stand up events. The space is very crowded. And it simply doesn't worth the $20-30 admission those events typically charge, only to be frustrated by the lines and the crowd.\n\nSummer Pops Tips:\n1. Summer Pops now are $10pp, $15 for the July 4th (7/3/2014 this year) event. You can buy online up until Friday afternoon, or you have 3 stations to buy from on day of. \""""Gate\"""" opens at 5pm, and there are going to be some crazy people who think they need to rush and cut in front of you and run to stake their spots. Try not to be the crazy person.\n2. Bring something heavy to put on the corners in case it's a windy day, but otherwise the blanket won't fly away. I managed to find some leftover bricks lying aside and a large fallen tree branch.\n3. Low chairs please. Don't be THAT person with the full size tailgate chair, because you're blocking everyone else behind you.\n4. Consider being there at 5pm to get the spot, then LEAVE. It's HOT, HOT, HOT out there. Enjoy a nice dinner nearby (you can even walk so you don't leave the prime parking spot you got). That way you can support the nearby eateries (I used to wait tables in Southpark years ago, and Sundays in June were horrible for business), stay out of the heat, and still be back in time for prelude.",1,0
"Okay so it's been about seven months since i first reviewed this place and i've been coming back many times. \n\nBeen back quite a few time to get the egg noodle and shrimp wonton stoup which Toni T claims the closest thing to traditional tasting. Would i agree to this statement? I dont know, never been anywhere that has enough reasonable creditably to establish themselves as THE place to get shrimp wontons. Regardless the wontons were stuffed with minced/smashed shrimp thus giving a nice plump shrimpy texture. they didnt cut corners by throwing all those tasty shrimp into a food processor till it was just a mush. The soup wasnt bad either and didnt contain that much MSG which is a HUGE plus\n\nIf you're not in the mood for soup, and who is these days with summer right around the corner as soon as the weather ponies finish winter warp up (MLP reference!!) then go for the two bbq combo rice plate. I grab bbq pork and roast pork. If you're getting take out then dont expect any soup to come with your order but dining in rates you some soup. \n\nOverall i'd like to stop by more to try other things on the menu as well. Problem is very rarely do i get cravings for Chinese food. I actually crave Mexican more than i do Chinese which is just down right..weird...\n\n\nYelp 100 - 022 of 100",1,0
"I've always dreamed of going to Paris for all the perks and sight-seeing one can do in such a foreign place. Unfortunately, I've heard that the French aren't too fond of ANYTHING American :( Is that true? Because I like the French. Most especially the food! I haven't been able to go to Paris yet, but the Paris Hotel may be the closest I will get to being there for a while, so, I shall enjoy what I have at the moment.\n\nThe very first time I went here was with my girlfriend on date. Often times we like to tour the city as if we've never been here and well, Mon Ami Gabi was already her favorite and she introduced this elegant place on the Las Vegas strip. I would recommend calling ahead for reservations as this place tends to become very busy and crowded. If you're lucky enough, request for the patio and it places you right across the street from the Bellagio fountains. It is a spectacular feat when you're with that special person enjoying a lovely dinner! :)\n\nAs soon as your server greets, you'll be asked for your choice of drink. I'm a water person so, I'll always get water. For you wine and champagne drinkers, ask your server what they would recommend with your meal. The servers are pretty knowledgable of the perfect dinner match. They'll serve with French bread and a carrot salad or slaw. It doesn't come with very much flavor so if you're worried about ruining your palette for what's to come, you needn't worry.  We usually order the steamed mussels in a leek cream.  It changed recently so it isn't as great as it used to be.  The whole serving size isn't the same size as what it used to be, so you won't get as much as before, but still a tasty appetizer.\n\nAnd now for the main course.......\nFilet with red wine reduction and merlot butter cooked to medium :9\""""\""""\"""" yum! This is my girlfriend's favorite steak for 1) The flavor of the reduction with the merlot butter, 2) the merlot butter, 3) The way the steak is cooked to perfection so that it melts in your mouth! Mmm... The filet is also served with frites (french fries). I have tried the different steaks like the Steak Roquefort (bleu cheese sauce) and the Steak Bordelaise (red wine). It depends on the flavor you're craving but regardless of which steak you're ordering, your choice will always be a tasty one. I've returned numerous times to enjoy the service, the atmosphere, and most of all the food. I'm already looking forward to the next time while typing this review. So I would definitely return! Enjoy and happy eating!",1,0

"This is supposed to provide veterinary services and they do have professionals on the premises. A few years ago this store did help us with a dog having problems. Today they weren't doing so well. We needed a prescription from our Oregon vet filled. My wife called three times to confirm it could  be done and get a fax number. Our vet faxed it. We then visited a crowded, hectic waiting room and after 15 minutes found they don't fill prescriptions. I understand licensing though I don't understand why they don't have a license to sell dog medicine. My problem is that they didn't tell us they couldn't until we had considerable time invested.

"It pains me extremely to give Amore only 3 stars!!  We have been going to/ordering from here very often for over a year, even when I was diagnosed with Celiac and had to go gluten-free. I waited patiently only ordering Chicken Vesuvio, until they recently started carrying gluten-free products.  \n\nNow I realize when ordering in I take the risk of being contaminated, but thankfully not only am I very aware  but as well am a bit paranoid...  I have never had a problem ordering from there gluten or otherwise, until tonight!!  I ordered gluten-free pasta and received the complete opposite in WHEAT!!  I called questioning and it was treated nonchalantly as if a pizza arrived with wrong toppings rather than the fact I was almost poisoned, which would land me in the hospital immediately...  Not only were they completely flippant about what just happened,. I even needed to be the one to bring up about being refunded!  After a brief verbal brawl I finally just gave the phone back to the delivery guy, since he was yelling for it back, he gave us our refund and I handed him back the re-made meal, there was no way I was eating their food ever again!\n\nAs I said before, I hate deducting stars from a place I love so much but if them giving me wheat pasta wasn't bad enough they showed little to no remorse to a VERY FREQUENT customer!!

He truly lost me as a customer when he said \""""I only ordered this stuff for YOU POEOPLE.\""""  And continued on stating that he would take if off if he could.  I have never thought the bigotry I would endure in life would be because of an illness which limits what I can eat!  Shame on this place!  I could have become seriously ill from their mistake and his only response was a chuckle saying, \""""What, am I supposed to sign off on all Gluten-Free items that leave the kitchen?\""""  No Jackhole, you are supposed to educate your staff when you take on the responsibility of serving a very large community of people who are doing this not by choice but for survival!",0,0
"Came here during the wine walk. I'm not exactly sure when it opened, but I know it must've been recently. \n\nThe crew members are very friendly and knowledgeable.

I ended up just getting a refreshing iced tea (it seems like that's all I've been getting at coffee shops lately). I wanted a frappe, but I didn't feel like spending $3.95 on a small that was going to melt the second I walked out the doors.

"Mainland is good if you don't really know what good Asian food is. I understand its \""""fusion\"""" but I find that that term is more often used for a conglomerate of the strongest of flavors Asian cuisine has to offer, typically the saltiest, sweetest, sourest, etc. Rarely, if ever, is it used to describe an accurate and enlightening combination of cuisines. In any case, Mainland offered exactly the fusion I'd expected. I had the crispy noodle wonton soup, which tasted great until half way through when my body knew to stop before the sodium had absorbed all the water in my body and I shriveled up. As if casino air wasn't bad enough for my hydration. Plus, I come from the SGV, so $14 for a bowl of noodles is ludicrous when I can hit up a Garden Cafe or other such spot and get a better version for $5.95. Guess I'm spoiled. My co-worker had the pork-chop, which was served in a bowl, and when she asked for a knife and fork they gave her a butter knife. ahahaha....On the up side, the wontons in my soup were pretty darn good and unlike my ghetto joints here at home, had all pork and shrimp in them.",0,1

"Disappointing.  \n\nI've eaten here about 5 times over the last couple years.  This review is for the last two times, over the last 1 year.  \n\nFirst, service has been bad on both occasions.  Seems like they either have assigned twice as many tables to each waiter as they should, or the waiters just are rude, but I have experienced unacceptable waits for each stage of the dining on both occasions, with two separate servers, so there is a real problem.  With that said, servers were nice and professional when they were there... just took too long.\n\nSecond, atmosphere is just okay.  You're typical mid-market seafood joint.  \n\nThird, the food is just okay.  I mean it's maybe a 3 out of 5 stars, depending on what you order.  Portions are on the smaller side.  I've tried the Mahi Mahi (crispy fried in olive oil on outside with what tasted like a Montreal Steak Seasoning), as well as their Scallops.  The scallops were by far the best.\n\nThe fresh sourdough bread is outstanding... I could eat several baskets if I let myself!\n\nBut for my fourth point, and the most important, the VALUE is NOT there.  It's too expensive for what you get.  I feel like every entree, if it was $3-4 cheaper, would be fair price.  Maybe.  But for just \""""average to good\"""" food, it's not worth the prices.  \n\nI told myself after eating there last night I won't be back.  Perhaps I'll forget that pledge, but I hope not.

"In a word: HORRENDOUS!\nI don't think anything I will state in this review will be news.  Their check-in process needs major workflow evaluation.  We got there at 7:30pm and it took almost 45 minutes to get to the desk.  That's ridiculous and I can only imagine what it would have been at 4pm.\nThe front desk clerk immediately informed me that the king bed we requested wasn't available, but we could upgrade to a luxury room. No sorry, no concern, just... an upsell.  I informed her that we would stick with what was given to us, but she quickly informs us that once we get into the room and decide we want to upgrade to a \""""luxury\"""" room, go back down and let her know and she would change our rooms.  As we went to the Mediterranean Tower, we noticed that the hallways were dimly lit, the carpets were stained, and there was a musty smell.  This was indicative of what we found inside as well.  The room was VERY dated, the air conditioning was sputtering, and state of the furnishings were sad.  We immediately picked up the phone to inform the front desk that we would like to upgrade.  The man who picked up flat out denied our request for an upgrade.  Mind you, we said we were willing to pay for the upgrade, we weren't looking for a handout.  The man stated that since we step foot into the room, he would have to have it cleaned and he didn't have the staffing for that.  We explained that the front desk clerk who checked us in offered to have us examine the room first.  He states that she wasn't allowed to do that and he will not upgrade us.  We asked to speak with a manager and he states that he WAS the hotel manager.  If this was indeed the case, this is the worst customer service I've encountered.  What hotel would refuse a customer PAYING for an upgrade?  He then states that he can send a maid up to tidy up the room if we were unhappy... but weren't we just informed that he didn't have the staff for that?  So the maid he was going to send up wouldn't be the same one who can clean the room we had \""""soiled\"""" by just stepping in?  Things didn't add up.\nAnyhow, the room was in shambles, as you can see from the pictures I'll post.  Mold in the shower, peeling wallpaper, soiled/ripped linens, the list goes on and on.  We didn't expect a 5 star hotel, but the dilapidated room PLUS the ridiculous management really soured our stay.  Never again for us or anyone we know.",0,0
"I've been to multiple Chili's before always with a pleasant experience.  You know what you're in for when you go.  Nothing extravagant, food doesn't blow you away, but for the price, its decent and its a good atmosphere.  Normally, no complaints.\n\nThis trip was different.  Our server was Jason and from the moment he walked by, I could tell he was going to be terrible.  His first interaction with us was him saying \""""Drinks?\"""" while looking at his cell phone.  We told him and it took a good 15 minutes to get a coke and a strawberry lemonade (which was awful by the way).  He gave us our drinks and then walked off again.  He only had one other table he was serving, so I'm not sure why he was never around.\n\nHe came back and squatted down saying \""""What are ya eating?\""""  We gave our orders while he constantly looked at and made signs to one of the other servers down the way.  Took our menus and off he went.  Another server delivered the food, refilled drinks twice and then Jason showed up with the bill.  Needless to say, he didn't receive much of a tip.\n\nI'll request not to have Jason if I decide to return again.",0,0
Location is awesome for people watching if you sit along the elevated glass railing overlooking the strip. My wife and I sat outside but near the inside of the restaurant. I was not impressed with the food but the location was amazing. The food was just ok I thought by the restaurant sitting on the sidewalk on the strip in front of the Miracle Mall I expected more. I did like the mist sprays to cool the air.,0,1

Whoo hoo. Suite upgrade! The Ivory Suite was very modern and spacious. Love the pink couch in the living room. Bathroom was spacious but no tub. I did not like the glass doors. I thought I broke it several times because it always made a loud noise when I closed it. Bed room was spacey but a little empty. a master bathroom and a restroom. I really enjoyed staying off the strip and away from its madness.,1,0
"Been here twice.  First time I sat at a table and service was good. Sushi Rolls were good. It was a Saturday night and it was kinda dead...which is odd for the great location and the great set up of the place. Went for a second time and again it was dead on a Friday night...this should have been a sign. Second time I took a date who is a cook and has written a few books.  Not a time for Jimmy's to drop the ball. We chose the bar seating this time.  Service was god awful slow and the drinks sat dry for quite a while...my date's broccoli and meat was out at least 15 minutes before my rolls. She took one bite and gave it back. It tasted like something out of Panda Express. It was taken off the bill, but we received no apology from management. I give it a star for location and ambiance and a star for good rolls.",0,1
"From a lack of organization and communication to charging for alcohol on an international cross-Atlantic flight, Air Canada's service was a disappointment every step of the way. \n\nIn Rome, we waited in line for an hour only to be stopped at the front for literally 100s of passengers to move in front of us for an earlier flight. I understand the need, but the lack of signage and communication meant we felt incredibly mistreated. I imagined at least five solutions to improve their set-up while we stood and watched people pass us. \n\nOnce onboard we found a standard US style card in the seat back pocket describing the snacks and drinks we could buy. On an international flight of 9+ hours? Though they never communicated what would happen, we were served meager food, but alcohol was a premium $6.50. \n\nWe'd flown to Italy on another Star Alliance airline, Lufthansa. They were fantastic in every way. Clear communication about services. Food and drink freely available between served meals. Free alcohol. \n\nI'll grant you, our flight was safe and relatively on time, but the experience is not one I'll repeat. I always say when flying international, use airlines outside the US. Except Air Canada. Their service is worse than ours!",0,0

We always feel so welcomed, almost like royalty with how incredible the service is. The most recent time we stayed it was our anniversary, and Paul Sipp and Kayla McCracken along with all the other staff in the Griffin Club made our experience so incredible. They personally set us up a white tablecloth personal table outside on the patio with some snacks, drinks and cards just for us. It was so amazing and made our anniversary that much more magical.\n\nWe plan on trying to come back at least once a month, just because of the service. I high recommend this hotel solely on the service of the Griffin Club. In addition the hotel rooms, grounds, pools, beds, everything is superb quality.",1,1

"Only stopped here for a quick check to see if they had tiramisu - they DID!  Score!  But overall, it's not worth saying much more about.

"Odd customer service model.  While there were only a few tables with customers when I came in (about three), I was given a menu from Kate who said Helen  would be my server.  Helen finally appeared from the back and took my order.  She then disappeared to the back.  Suddenly my check was on my table.  Ok, I understand this is an airport and they want to get paid before people jet. \nAgain, restaurant fairly empty, a customer who needed to pay her bill and get to her flight asked the bar tender, who was the only wait staff on the floor.  \""""I can't help you.  I was not your sever.\""""  Weird! Where's the teamwork?  The response should have been \""""let me get your server to help you.\""""  Finally her wait person appeared from the back (Helen) to settle the bill but then Helen disappeared to the back again.  The lady stood there and stood there holding some cash and her check.  She finally asked the bar tender to give it to Helen and that she can't wait any longer. \nMy burger arrived with a \""""this has a wonderful smell.\""""  \""""Helen\"""" I thought, \""""get your nose out of my food.\""""  My ice tea went empty.  \""""I sure need a refill to wash this dry bun burger down\"""" I thought to myself.  Finally when I had just one bite to go, I got a refill.  Again, with both Helen and Kate spending most of their time in the back.  I suspect they are chief cook and dishwasher as well as wait staff.  If you're sitting at a table, don't even think of asking or even looking at the bar tender.  She won't help.  \nWhat's a person to do though?  Stuck in the airport and it's the only \""""restaurant\"""" past security.\nLesson?  Eat before you arrive or \""""fill up\"""" on those crappy airline \""""meals for purchase.\""""",0,0
This place is so amazing that my 5 year old wants to come back.\n\nI could not have asked for anything more. They delivered more than expected to my son. The staff was amazing with him and made him feel so comfortable that he actually sat through an entire cleaning without being upset once. They had him put on sunglasses during the cleaning and he thought that was cool. They hygienist also told him about the sugar bugs living in his mouth and that he has to keep up brushing and flossing so the sugar bugs wont live in his mouth.\n\nThe dentist and the assistants were made to work with children and that made it all very relaxing and enjoyable for him.,1,1
"When I eat at a Ruth's Chris, I've come to expect excellent food and even better service.  My experience at this location, however, did not meet my expectations.\n\nIt's located in a strip mall so the parking was convenient, but the fa\u00e7ade was not very impressive.  Our party of 6 came in a bit staggered and our half was not greeted by anyone, instead we had to find our way to the table where the rest of our party was seated.\n\nThe waitress was friendly, but gave the \""""welcome to Ruth's Chris\"""" spiel with the enthusiasm of an airline stewardess explaining how to put on a life jacket in the event of a water landing.\n\nI ordered the Crabatini which was excellent.  A friend of mine ordered the calamari for the table, though, and it seemed like someone pulled the squid out and just fried up the breading.  It also really needed a remoulade or some kind of sauce to dip the fried bits into.  \n\nShortly before our steaks arrived, an overly gruff and visibly uncomfortable server's assistant arrived to direct us to avoid touching the plates as they are 500 degrees and to hold our napkins up so we don't get splattered with the sizzling butter our steaks would be bathing in.  My ribeye steak and the rest of our party's filets arrived.  After taking my first bite, I thought, where is all of the sizzling butter I was warned about and craved?  The steak was good, but just not as great as all of the other times I've been.  My side of sweet potato casserole was as delicious as I remember though.\n\nAfter finishing about  1/2 of my ribeye and settling into a meat coma, I realized that my mild irritation with the dining experience was not being helped by the view of the other servers loafing and leaning against the front counter or the excessively hot temperature in the room.  It is Vegas in the summer time; it is alright to crank the air conditioning up!  There was no dessert for me; I just wanted to flee the scene.  \n\nI am sure I'm being overly critical but Ruth's Chris is supposed to be a top notch steak house with superb service.  Other times I've visited rated 4.5 to 5 stars; maybe this location just needs some new management.   \n\nI will return, but just not to this location.",0,0
"This was the worst lunch I've had in quite some time and it cost me $16.00. I had never been to J. Alexander's before and was looking forward to it due to the good things I've heard. I ordered the rotisserie chicken, which is a half chicken served with a side. I elected to go with a side of vine ripened tomatoes, which was actually very good. The main issue I had with my lunch was with the chicken. For $16 I expected something much better. My meal came out very dry, it was actually so dry that it was crunchy. The waiter didn't seem to care that I had left almost all of my meal on the plate and just took it away. I can get a much better rotisserie chicken from Whole Foods for $10 and it's a whole chicken that is organic. I can't say that I'll be going back to J.

"I don't much like the look of this place - I never would have ventured in were it not for the positive yelp reviews - but they serve some pretty good pizza.  \n\nI have eaten trillions of pizzas.  Maybe more, I lost count.  And I'm not a a purist or a dogmatic devotee to any particular variety of pizza.  I grew up in Chicago, where I was weaned on deep dish, pan, and thin crust pizzas.  I lived in NYC for years, and tasted some of the finest thin crust on the planet.  (for the record, my favorites are DiFara's in Brooklyn and Coalfire, a relatively young pizza joint in Chicago).\n\nBrixx does a fine job of the thin crust.  We had a wild mushroom pie and their pear and gorgonzola variety for kicks.  Both were pretty tasty.    I'll go back for more whenever the opportunity arises.\n\nBut here's what they could do a little better:\n\nGet that oven hotter, and change the flour blend so that there's a crispness to the bottom and edges of the crust.  There's an axiom for thin crust pizza that goes something like, \""""if that shit don't crack, that shit is whack.\""""  So, when the pizza is folded, the bottom of the crust should crack.  Ditto for the edge of the crust.  (Allowances can be made for pizzas that have been ordered with soggy ingredients that necessarily soak through the crust, like spinach, ricotta, etc.)\n\nBrixx's pizza did not exhibit cracking anywhere.  It was cooked only to the point of being bread-like.  Still tasty enough, but not quite there.  I hate to sound snotty about this, but I think it really adds to the pizza when parts of the crust have been cooked almost to the point of burning.  That crunch and underlying chewiness is irresistible.\n\nAlso, the mushroom pizza was finished with a sprinkling of what appeared to be shaved romano and a tossing of arugula, but when that was added, the pizza had been allowed to cool to the point where the romano didn't melt at all, and the arugula didn't wilt.  The result was a bit like having a salad on top of a pizza.\n\nPizza aside, they offer local beers, at least one NC wine, and have eco-friendly waterless urinals in the men's room (I applaud the effort, though that probably won't be the highlight of the review).\n\nNext time I go in, I'll see it they can crispify my pie.",1,0

A new one I tried today was the lemon pie...a take on the key lime with a graham cracker crust layer...spectacular!\n\nI read some reviews complaining about the price.

"First, I hope management notices that this is a repeat review urging them to get rid of the gorilla. \n\nI was excited to see a brewery open up over here but I was let down with the food and the Nimbus beer. \n\nWe've tried pretzels, fried jalepenos, sliders and the spinach artichoke dip (no flavor, except for the chives and would never recommend or order again). I've tried all of the different beers and favorite so far is the red, with a taste of honey, but all the other beers are just okay. \n\nWe asked our server if they have a Nimbus IPA, he said yes, but then returned to let us know he was confused and suggested some other local beers.\n\nIt's kind of a weird vibe because it seems like brewery but there is a mascot gorilla running around to be awkward with patrons and they have cartoons on TV during happy hour.

I've had really bad experience with this particular dealership. It is not the way they greeted me or the way they treated me but it is the way that they overcharged an overpriced each item that I was supposed to have done to my car.

They told me that items needed to be repaired the head only been repaired a week prior buy them and expected eight thousand dollars to repair items that were repaired for under $800. \n\nIs my opinion that this dealership take advantage of people who are not mechanically inclined or old people do not know what things are really wrong with your car. \n\nI truly feel sorry for someone who goes there and does not have any automotive experience.

While the owner payed a lot of attention to detail when decorating this place, the same cannot be said of the food.  Everything was off.

The view for this place is nice and their food tasted not too bad but the price just doesn't justify what you get. They have some of the smallest portions I have ever seen for a pretty penny.

You could smell the tobasco sauce, and he just said that he got it all, but you could see it on the jacket, so I asked for a manager.  The manager came over, and admitted the server had an attitude, and gave me his card, and told me to get the jacket and sweater dry cleaned and to bring him the bill.  He also said he would take care of us, and provide us with another waiter.  Dinner went on.....came time for dessert, and I couldn't decide between two desserts, so the new server suggested the upside apple cake, but said it would take 8 mins, and we asked to have our coffee with the dessert.  After about 15 mins, the server came back with the coffee, and said the dessert chef got behind so it will take a minute more, but he decided to bring our coffee.  Now 15 mins later, so a total of 30 mins now, we have finished our coffee, and here comes the waiter with our apple dessert and the other dessert we asked about but did not order, he said the manager said to bring both.  We waited and finally asked for the check, and the waiter said the manager took off the appetizer (cheese plate, $15) and the cheesecake dessert, the alternate dessert that we did not order, but charged us for the dessert we ordered.  I then went to the manager, and he said that was not right, he told the waiter to take off the appetizer, and the dessert, and I told the manager, but I only ordered one dessert, it wasn't my idea to bring the cheesecake dessert also.  So they ran a credit on my husband's credit card for the first check with the dessert, and took off the dessert, and then ran it again.  First, of all how are you not charging me for a dessert I didn't order, and really for all that trouble, and spilling tobasco on my husband, that is the only compensation, $15 cheese platter, and a $8 dessert?

"We decided to stop in during a recent trip to Vegas after seeing the dinner in the show Hungry Investors. I must admit, the food was amazing and just as the show highlighted the service was slow.

"HOW CAN I FORGET TO REVIEW XS LAS VEGAS OH MY GOD.\n\nI went to Vegas back in August of this year and it was absolutely the best time of my life! My friends and I went to XS on a Monday night for \""""Dim Mak\"""" Mondays to see of course, the one and only Steve Aoki! It was hands down, the best time in a nightclub I had in awhile. I'm from NYC and saying this means A LOT. You know NYC has a lot of great clubs and such but nothing, NOTHING compared to XS. We had free champagne thanks to Aoki's performance and of course some free cake! (Aoki fans know what I'm talking about!) \n\nAdmission for ladies was free of course, especially if you know a promoter. The ratio thing is a really big deal, and I don't blame promoters for asking for a lot of girls because a room full of dudes could get kinda weird. My guy friends paid $20 to get in, probably better than some guys who didn't have any promoter buddies and ended up paying up $40-$60 .. just to get in. So get a promoter, boys and a lot of girlies. The more girls, the easier guys can get in for a cheap price or even free! \n\nNext time I'm in vegas, I will be coming back! The people are sexy, the DJs are crazy and drinks get you drunk. I really need to stay at the Encore or Wynn to make it much easier to get back to the hotel room after experiencing XS. \n\nExpect to spend a lot, it is VEGAS. Get ready people for the best time of your LIFE!",1,1

"I realize it's new, and we expected (to a degree) some hiccups, but I'm still paying for my stay as normal, so I don't think what we received in return was acceptable.\nBottom line- the staff has clearly has not had adequate training and time to be able to operate this hotel yet. \n\nArrival: It was not clear which entrance was for check-in and which was the side more for clubs.\n\nCheck in: Rate did not match what i had reserved and what was on my confirmation. So an already slow process took longer since a manager had to sort that out. I had booked directly on the SLS website as well. Meanwhile - during all this wait, the bellman is stuck standing there with our stuff on a cart as he goes up with us at the same time.\n\nValet: Awful. Waiting area small and dangerous. The female attendant who \""""helped\"""" me after we had been waiting 30 minutes for our car should not be in any type of position that deals with customers. Rude, snide and unhelpful, even when we were about to miss our show. We were beyond patient.\n\nSelf-parking: after the Valet debacle, we chose to self-park (Valet was always full after that anyways- no choice.) Many people driving the wrong way because it's not marked and as many have said, some elevators didn't work, but weren't marked as such.\n\nPerq: 10 people working, but clearly struggling on how to make the  coffee drinks. Everyone waiting a good 15 minutes for their beverages, when there was virtually no line.\n\nGriddle Cafe: Had nice service with Alexis. Food was ok. This was at 12:00am though. Wait was ridiculous otherwise and they wouldn't take reservations for breakfast.\n\nMini-bar: not fully stocked, no price menu.\n\nRoom: small but nice. However, mini blinds and a pull down shade that doesn't fully block out light? In Vegas? Really? Gave it a motel feel. We had to try to stick towels around the window so we didn't get an early morning sunshine wake-up call that we didn't want.  And the pull down shade was so weird with a group of people on it? Supposed to be cool I guess but really was quite creepy.\n\nCheck-out: I couldn't check out on the TV screen because my charges were wrong again and no one answered the phone, so I had to wait in line and it took the front desk staff about 10-15 minutes for EACH person in line.\n\nHopefully they can get it together......hotels kinda get one chance with customers to get it right. Plenty of other choices in this price range so it's not like I'm going to \""""try\"""" them again.",0,0

"I came to this auto service thinking they were dependable and cheaper having so many branches in the city. Wrong. They quoted me $100 which my dealership would have charged.  I assumed since I am the only customer there that it would be quick since I am going out of town right after this last task of changing my oil.  They took 45 minutes to take my car in the back then take another 45 minutes to tell me they don't have the air filter in stock so they have to get it at my dealership. I have already told them I am going out of town and that I am in a rush but they weren't concerned about that. I said I would just get the oil change done at my dealership since the price isn't different and the simple fact it would take longer now. They said they drained the oil out so I couldn't drive it and that I was stuck. What kind of mechanic dissembles a car before checking on tools/stock? They just wanted my money and weren't going to let me leave without it. I was upset and asked why it took them over an hour and half to communicate anything to me and now leave me stranded. They didn't have any answers for me except that someone is on their way to get the air filter. I wait another hour now over 3 hours. I ask what the status is and they weren't concerned with making me feel better about this situation just satisfied that I have to pay them. Finally almost 4 hours later the car is done and I still had to pay $100.  They even smirked stating they could have charged me more.  Do not EVER go here, they have a teenager working the front desk and a bitter Asian lady dodging all customers letting the kid take care of everything. Disgusting.",0,0
"I will begin this review by saying that I am an open minded person, and I usually find at least one thing to like about a bar or club. I am also aware of the variety of subcultures that are popular now. With that being said, avoid this toilet at all costs! We paid a $10 cover on a Saturday night to be jam packed into a hot, sweaty hipster hellhole. Drinks we're expensive and came in the crappiest plastic cups ever. If the bottom floor of pseudo artists, dancers, models and intellectuals bores you, go upstairs and indulge in a second floor of the worst people that society has to offer. Also, if you're a guy, avoid the bathroom at all costs. Find a pseudo artist or model and give them your bowels as sustenance or as art; the bathroom only boasts one stall with no door, and the stall walls are waist high. Forget about dropping a deuce here, just do it on the floor, the art crowd will appreciate you! Also, avoid making eye contact with the bathroom attendant from Mogadishu; he will insist on a tip for creepily watching you do your business. Why the fuck does a shitty little club need a bathroom attendant anyways? Music was ok but its too hard to be able to get into it when the club is dangerously overcrowded. All in all, if you fancy yourself some kind of scholar of the arts, or if you think you're a model, go here. If you went to college for a journalism degree, or a fine arts degree, come here. If you think the Cornish Pasty in Tempe is the greatest thing ever, come here. If you wear v neck t shirts out in public while sporting an amish hat, come here. If you just started riding motorcycles and consider yourself a 1% outlaw, come here cause you'll think you're the toughest biker in the world. For the rest of you, skip this shithole and go to Sanctum instead.",0,0
"The service was terrible - the food was not much better. We waited forever for our drink orders, but tried to give them the benefit of the doubt because our kids had to get milk from the bar. When we had to get the chip guy to refill our drinks, I knew it was no fluke. \n\nWe then pulled up the Yelp reviews and read all about what we were living at that moment. But as we hasn't gotten our food yet, we still had to wait. \n\nI was full of chips and water, so I wasn't  able to finish main course. The only reason I took it home was because I was taught as a child not to waste food. \n\nWon't be back-ever. Wasn't all  bad, but with so many good restaurants within a couple of miles, eating here would be a waste of time and money.",0,0
"Listen: I'm just going to cut to the chase. If heaven had a bakery, I'm pretty confident it would be La Gourmandine.\n\nI've been dying to come here for ages now, and I'm kicking myself for not coming sooner. When I walked in, I was greeted immediately and everyone was very friendly. It felt just the way a bakery should feel: quaint, homey, and it smelled wonderful.\n\nI was immediately skeptical when I entered the bakery, however, because the girl behind the counter was really skinny and pretty. I typically don't trust bakeries with skinny employees. But not to worry, this place is legit, I promise. Obviously, everything looked amazing so I asked the girl there for some recommendations. She basically recommended everything and then said, \""""Oh, how could I forget about the cream puff!\"""" I pretty much so wanted to ask if she wanted to be best friends on the spot, but instead replied, \""""Yeah, I'll take one of those, too.\""""\n\nI left the bakery with 5 huge pastries because I obviously couldn't decide on just two. I apologize to my already non-existent waistline. I was trying to get things for my better half and I to enjoy together this weekend, but he's still at work and I can make no promises that there will be any left by the time he makes it home.\n\nAs I was checking out, my new BFF said, \""""Oh, you should come back here earlier in the day, we have twice the selection!\"""" I'm literally glad I didn't come earlier in the day, or I probably would have left with 10 pastries.

But my excuse is that I'm an international traveler in your fine city!\n\nAnyway, I was starving and was determined to find this joint after reading all these great reviews. I had the 1/4 chicken leg combo, which was translated to me by a really nice couple (the menu is in French FYI). I watched in amazement as the cook chopped up the meat and piled it with a TON of fries!!! The meal could easily feed a family of four! It also comes with rice and a salad. But honestly you can't see what's underneath the giant pile of fries!\n\nThe chicken had a lovely taste to it. The spicy sauce wasn't as spicy as I'd like it to be. And everything was a teensy bit too salty. If I had a friend to share it with, it would have been more manageable!  All in all a great neighborhood restaurant.

"I should have gone with my instincts and not come to this joke of a cake/cupcake business.  First, the lady at the counter was not pleasant at all.  She was blatantly rude to my sister and I.

She was lucky that I was on a time crunch and needed to order cupcakes for my husband's birthday or else I would have given her a piece of my mind.  \n\nPrior to coming here, I bought a groupon for the cupcakes I wanted to order.  When I had used my groupon initially she did not charge me for tax; however, upon picking up my order, she told me that I needed to pay for tax.  Wth?!  Who charges tax after a transaction has been made?  I was throughly irritated with this b*****.  To top it off, the cupcakes were small and were very bland.

With a couple of drinks, just be prepared to spend over $100/pp because even just a bottle of water (imported from Wales) will cost you $8. But, hey it's Vegas.

"This dry cleaner recently took over from the previous owners that I decided to stop going to because they didn't accommodate alterations on site. My daughter wanted a neighborhood cleaner to bring her Sanctuary Elements uniform to...a Diane Von Furstenberg dress that she has to have cleaned weekly. She asked me to drop off her dress so I decided to add a White House/Black Market cotton/viscose sweater to be cleaned. White House is my go-to store for all my work clothes.\n\nWhen I went to pick up the dress and sweater, my sweater was BEIGE!!! The young girl behind the counter saw my face and said \""""Is their something wrong?\"""" I said \""""Yes, my white sweater looks like its been ruined. It was white.\"""" She said \""""I'm sorry, we've had trouble with the guy in the back.  I will put it back through to be cleaned again.\""""  I relented.\n\nA week later I went to pick it up. Now, let me tell you. A cotton and viscose sweater has a shiny thread appearance to it. It is has a lusterous rather than matte fabric.  My sweater looked beat-up, dingy, grayed, frayed and lacked the original luster it held. Obviously, the cleaners damaged it the first time and in order to get the discoloration or polluted smog out of it they had to bleach it. The sweater recommends you use non-chlorine bleach. It has the option to hand wash or dry clean. The owner Martin happened to be the one I was greeted by upon pick up. I very calmly spoke to him and told him I was not happy. I said, \""""My sweater is ruined. It's lost its white color and is quite frayed. It's not shiny anymore.\"""" He said, \""""I am sorry and paused.\"""" I said, \""""I would like it replaced.\"""" He said, \""""You will have to find your receipt. Bring a copy of your receipt and I will reimburse you.\"""" I agreed and he asked to retain the sweater.\n\nThis sweater wasn't horribly expensive. It was $88 but i got it on sale for $66.88. I keep all my receipts and found it. I returned one week later and left off a copy of the receipt with a new clerk.  I was told I would get a call when my check was ready to be picked up.\n\nI didn't get a call back. This was a busy time for me so i finally got over there on Christmas Eve to pick up my reimbursement check. Martin was there. He said \""""I am not going to reimburse you. I took your sweater to the White House/Black Market store and spoke to two sales people and the manager. I compared your sweater to another similar sweater and everyone agreed it was just like new.\"""" I was flabbergasted.  I said, \""""You're kidding right? You went to the store?  I'm embarrassed for you. You can't tell it has been ruined? Your clerk said that you had trouble with another work who turned it beige.\""""  He said something like ... the sweater was cleaned properly and I have been reassured by the store it is in its original condition.  I don't remember what he said after that.  I can't believe a store would not stand by its customer's disapproval of their services and not make amends.  \n\nYou guys!  My sweater is un-wearable! It's off to Goodwill. I am not the kind of person to get mad at vendors. I don't complain and if you ask anyone I am usually overly agreeable and provoke a group consensus. \n\nI also am going to write customer service at White House. I find them to be a reputable company that stands behind their products. I think Martin wanted to be right instead of satisfying a customer. All over $66.88. Ridiculous!  I would not recommend this company. My daughter has told the Sanctuary to not use this dry cleaner either for their uniforms. \n\nThey have two locations. Please don't go to either one of them. at 3375 E. Shea Blvd. or 9301 E. Shea Blvd.",0,0

He would be happy to chat for hours about making beer, sterilizing equipment, good beer kits etc.  I decided to buy a starter kit which is just about \u00a380 and gets you everything you need to brew batch after batch of beer, including a first kit of your choosing and 40 bottles.  I was all set to go when he asked \""""have you brought your car?\"""" Er, no.  \""""That's ok, I can hold the kit (two boxes of bottles and one tub of brewing goods) for you until you can bring the car this weekend\""""  Er, The driver of the car is the birthday boy.  \""""Oh right, well then do you live close?  I can just drop it off on my way home on Satuday.\""""\nSeriously???  \nI was impressed.  Mega impressed.

I think the only thing that made us giggle a little was whole oral sex with a nanner flick--but hey, we never claimed to be mature. \n\nAs you already know, this building is packed floor after floor with mesmerizing works of art, photos, videos and information about the interesting life of Andy Warhol himself. In fact, I would have loved even more nitty-gritty info about his short time on this earth. I'm not sure I've ever taken so much time in a museum to make sure I read every minuet detail. \n\nI know it's probably clich\u00e9, but The Silver Cloud Room blew my friggin' mind. I must have stood in there for like 10 minutes just staring at these floating pillows of silver crash into one another and well--me.

You just sit on the bench in the middle and soak in your own interpretation. I sat in the Skull room and just looked up in awe. \n\nI really think everyone should experience this museum at least once in their lifetime. The work of this fascinating man truly spoke of the art and times of our generation. it was new, different and left so much room for individual interpretation. I think that's what I love the most. Warhol's work doesn't tell you what to think, it let's you figure it out yourself. \n\nOne thing I could do without would be the pretentious preteens running the admissions desk.

Somehow we found ourselves in Bill's Gamblin' Hall because one of our friends could swear they had steak and eggs.  Luckily, they did AND it was only $6.99.  It came with eggs, hash brown, toast, and steak.  Our server (Ervin) was super nice.  Our orders came out just as we wanted them (and we all asked for different ways to cook the eggs and steak).  All-in-all, we left as very happy and full customers!",1,1
"I guess it's good for Vegas!  Thank goodness we didn't have to wait too long for ramen that is just ok!  My husband got the tonkatsu ramen, had no idea it didn't come with an egg (everywhere we eat at they give you an egg) so that's odd.  Then we tried the soup, wayy too salty.  My husband added water, about half a cup to dilute it, tasted so much better.  There really is no service.  We sat down, ordered and paid and that's pretty much it.  Don't expect to much.  We came in with high expectations because of the reviews, but left disappointed and hungry!",0,0
"Some coworkers and I went to have lunch here at their Chandler location and they forgot to hand us lunch menus. Then our waitress had a family emergency phone call in the middle of our service and we were passed onto someone else. Our food came out and most of it was cold. Also, they completely forgot to bring out one of my coworker's order. Our original waitress eventually returned but we went great lengths of time between refills and waiting for our bill. \n\nSo basically, the food was average to below average and the service was definitely below average. It was enough to turn me off from the place for good.",0,0
"AC died on a Friday, called several places Sat morning, only Flores picked up the phone (left several messages for others -no response). They couldn't fit me in Sat so I scheduled for Wed at 4. Tech showed up at 445 (called earlier to confirm, let me know he was running a little late). He was courteous and professional, and friendly. \n\nAfter some troubleshooting (fuses, wiring) he confirmed it was a dead transformer and installed a new one.   Tested fine, gave a me a years warrantee and his number in case there were any other problems in the short term. He said it was unusual for a transformer to die with no visible signs of why it failed and to hold onto the receipt just in case. No up selling, no BS, no games - just thorough and friendly. AC fixed for well under $200 - bargain. Highly recommended!",1,1

"I am sad to have to write this review, since I love finding great businesses\nand deals to share with friends/family/etc. Unfortunately, I will NOT be\nrecommending Simplicity Laser to anyone. In fact, I will be warning people\nNOT to waste their time and/or money there. I purchased a Groupon about a\nyear ago for laser hair removal treatments. I have done laser hair removal\nbefore at Advanced Laser Clinics and got awesome results. I have several\nfriends and family members who have also had laser hair removal done at ALC\nas well as other places. All of them have had great results as well. So, I\nam no stranger to laser hair removal and how it works. So, my groupon was\nfor 8 treatments, with 4-6 weeks between each treatment. I spent the last\nyear of my life driving 40 minutes to and from Simplicity Laser (in\nGlendale) every 4-6 weeks. I have been finished with my treatments now for\nabout a month. I literally can't tell any difference in the amount of hair I\nhave in the treated area. I will generously say that i have had MAYBE 10-20%\nreduction. This is absolutely NOT typical and unacceptable. I mentioned my\nconcerns several times during my appointments and was blown off each time. I\ncalled to speak to a manager and was told that I should make a \""""client\nreview\"""" appointment to discuss my results and a possible resolution. I had\nmy \""""client review\"""" today and was basically blown off again, and told that\nthey weren't going to do anything to help me unless I purchased more\ntreatments. Basically, this company gets you in the door with, what seems\nlike, a good deal...and then treats you at a low level on the machine...all\nthe while trying to sell you more treatments. A good company will treat you\naggressively with the machines, so that you see results. And then you'll\ncome back to them because they work. I am very disappointed in this company\nand their business ethic, customer service, etc.",0,0

They came with sides of dirty rice, corn bread, green beans, collard greens and mac & cheese.  All the fried stuff were decently crispy, but somewhat unseasoned and not particularly memorable.  \n\nThe sides stood out more...but not in a good way.Rarely do I wish that a restaurant would use Kraft's blue box for the Mac & Cheese, but in this case it would have been an improvement.

"In a nutshell, if you like XS, you will like Surrender. It's a tad more low key, but still felt very much a \""""club\"""" rather than a \""""lounge\"""" when I was there last Saturday.

The \""""snake room\"""" if you will was the place where people congregated. I enjoyed dancing by our table in crowd free luxury, but if you are looking for a crowded dance floor, Surrender delivers.\n*People were dressed up just as much as XS/Tryst/etc\n*The tables weren't \""""set up\"""" as well in my opinion. We had a couch that felt very much like cheap patio furniture (it is a party pool during the day after all), and a table that felt like a cheap patio table. There was one akward cushion thing offered as well. Our table for 8 really only sat 4, but maybe this is normal at clubs, not sure. I know the point isn't to sit down anyways, but I will say bottle service here is far from luxurious. Their prices are better, but in some respects you get what you pay for. \n*Service was decent. A drink got spilled by our bar back all over my friend, but they didn't really apologize or attempt to right the situation. \n\nOverall we got a great deal on bottle service (compared to XS/Tryst/Tao/etc), and I think it was money well spent. The club was really fun, but not qutie as miserable and crowded as some of the bigger clubs get. Music was decent, and I always love a good indoor/outdoor scene!",1,1

The hotel ground and pool area is pretty nice and well kept . The staff are friendly but not so helpful. For instance gave us no advise of where to walk the dog or which areas we're supposed to keep the dog away from. Also when we scheduled the room service for the next day( you have to let them know if you have a dog in the room in advance) and took the dog for a walk and came back and the room wasn't cleaned after 2 hours. The rooms are dusty and don't feel clean . The carpets in the rooms and hallways are old and don't look or feel clean. The air conditioner in the rooms wasn't working \nAnd they brought us a floor heater which wasn't enough to keep the room warm in the cold winter.The  4 paws program costs $150 per 6 day stay and all they gave us was an old dirty pet bed and a pet dish which we didn't think was clean to use .The towels in the room were old and felt like they've been used for many many years. Overall the ground and the pools were the nicest part of the hotel and the rooms were the worst part of the hotel did not feel like a five star hotel. Oh and the beds are super uncomfortable and so as the pillows. We were here for our first year wedding anniversary and it was noted in the reservation but not once was acknowledged. The food is pricey and not really worth it . Two orders of salmon and a guacamole and chips starter cost us almost $70 . The next day we went out and shopped for dinner.,0,0

"Without a doubt, this is my favorite sushi spot in Las Vegas. \n\nSince Eric, the owner/main sushi chef, took over back in 2008 this place has been FANTASTIC. \n\nAs far as pinpointing my favorite item on the menu...that's difficult. I love the Passion Roll and the Tuna Karai, which is EXTRA spicy here. The Screaming Orgasm is also fantastic.\n\nAll of the hot food I've ever had here has been great as well, especially the Bulgogi Beef and the green onion pancakes. Absolutely delicious!\n\nAside from the fact that Eric is a fantastic cook, he is a very warm and friendly person.

He's also occasionally makes me a random roll for free to try out and none of these random dishes have ever been disappointing!\n\nWhile some will be turned off by the fact that this spot doesn't have an \""""All You Can Eat\"""" option, I think it's worth the extra money considering how amazing the food tastes.",1,1

"This was my favorite lunch spot in Montreal.  My wife and I were there on a busy Saturday and only waited 5 minutes to be seated.  The system is very simple.  You order your food at the counter in the back then sit down and wait about 15 minutes for it.  \n\nI had Le Cubain (ham, braised pork, homemade mayo, and gruyere cheese in a panini) and a bite of my wife's Poulet de Grain Cajun (chicken, guacamole, tomatoes, mango fraiche and cajun spices).  Both were delicious with lots flavors going on and a little kick from the spices.  We each had a glass of their vanilla lemonade too.  I'd never had vanilla lemonade so I didn't know what to expect but I liked it.\n\nWhen you're done you pay at the register while getting an almond croissant to go.  You must not leave without one!

"There have been many times when I knew right away that I was in love with a burger, but rarely have I disliked one instantly. That is until now of course, in the case of Cheeburger Cheeburger. I actually stated \""""I hate this bun\"""" as soon as I swallowed my first bite, and it only went downhill from there. Read on if you dare.\n\nThere are apparently many locations all over the country of this place, although I can't say it's really been on my radar aside from a few recommendations through friends in town. And after my experience, I'm not sure if I would consider these folks my friends... the interior is kind of like a stand-alone Johnny Rockets; 50's diner style right down to the cheesy neon and stainless steel on the walls. It's extremely gimmicky, and much worse than any Fatburger I've ever been near. It wasn't overly crowded the night I was there for dinner, but there were several families and it really confused me as to how this place is popular.\n\nThe menu offers burgers ranging from 1lb down to a 5.5 ounce 'beginner', along with chicken sandwiches, wraps, salads and the option of supposedly over 1,285,000 combinations of shakes. They offer some odd toppings such as peanut butter, pepperoni and salsa. I guess there are options for anyone looking to create a disgusting burger.\n\nI was excited to see Heinz 57 sauce as an option, and mistakenly ordered it on my burger along with mushrooms, lettuce and tomato. As I said, upon first bite the bun turned me off; it was incredibly dry, had no flavor, and was way too thick and large for the sandwich. It was grilled and buttered on the inside, but that little bit of flavor couldn't compete with the vacuum of flavor created by the dryness. The meat was actually cooked quite well and had decent flavor, but the person I was eating with didn't have as much luck so I question their consistency and must assume I was lucky for now. My mushrooms had ok flavor but the small amount I was given got lost in the other flavors. And by other flavors I really just mean my Heinz 57 sauce, which completely took over the entire burger with its semi-BBQ flavor. I always thought I liked that sauce, but apparently not on burgers. I also must note that I only ordered the 1/3lb burger which I can easily handle, but this was so bad I only finished a little more than half.\n\nThe one positive factor of this meal was that because of my Foursquare check-in we were given a free order of small  1/2 fries and  1/2 onion rings. Both of them were ok; the fries were crispy and had decent flavor other than the couple of really undercooked ones that snuck in our basket. The onion rings were the thin, greasy, crispy battered type which I love, as opposed to the thick-breaded, hard to bite through variety. They were good, although I'm just not a huge fan of onion rings. They offer a few different dipping sauces; we went with the Zesty Horseradish sauce which was ok I guess.\n\nBy the time we were done with our meal we were completely dissatisfied and turned off by everything. We almost got mad that there were so many families and other people seemingly enjoying what they were eating. The only tasty parts of our meal were the Oreo and Peanut Butter Cup shakes we got, and that's not something I typically order. With the free fries and onion rings our meal cost $25.20, it would have been over $30 if those weren't free. This price does include $7.98 for two shakes, but is a bit too much for how unhappy we were. $6.99 for a burger isn't a bad price, especially off the strip, but what I was given I wouldn't pay for again. I'm not even going to sugarcoat it, just avoid this place.",0,1

"Sorely disappointing here. Caveat: I booked with a Priceline rate. \nHowever, the issues I experienced are issues no matter what you paid.\n\nLargest issue: Housekeeping/Cleanliness.\nMy family booked 3 rooms to stay in. I changed twice, due to noise and cleanliness in rooms.\nSo, I experienced 5 different rooms on two different floors.\nALL of them had mold/mildew in shower/bath area. ICK. It's hard to fathom that a 4 dollar bottle of Tilex could resolve this. \nALL of them had an issue with bed linens, either being dirty or incorrectly put on bed (ie, incorrect sheets top vs bottom, missing items, etc)\nMy second room I was in, I pulled back the sheets, and there was a LARGE black line/stain on the sheet. Can't miss it.\nIs housekeeping even looking at what they are doing? I'm always willing to roll with small things, as I know mold/mildew can creep up on any bathroom, but it was so prevalent, and in all corners/crevices in ALL 5 rooms.\nJust laziness? Incompetence? I don't know.\n\nThis in itself is unacceptable no matter what hotel you stay at, hell, the Red Roof Inn for $30 a night usually is pretty decently clean.\n\nOn top of this, the furniture is dinged up, the sliding doors into the bathroom in all of the rooms were dinged and dirty.\n\nThis hotel is billing itself as a notch ABOVE other Wyndhams, but being a \""""Grand\""""\n\nNothing Grand here. \n\nyes, wifi worked and was relatively fast.

"I can remember the day MGM first opened. I loved the huge lion at the entrance haha. Now that I am upwards of 21 and can actually enjoy Vegas, I have found myself at this hotel quite often.\n\nEven though a bit older, MGM offers nice clean rooms at reasonable rates. Over the years they have done upgrades that keep the decor and rooms nice and modern.\n\nHere is my breakdown.\n\n-Casino-I am not a big gambler, but my bf is. The dealers are always very nice and friendly, and the servers come around regularly and provide drinks. Never too busy, so you can usually get a spot at the table of your choice.\n\n-Pool\n* Decent, but nothing spectacular.\n\n-Restaurants-I have tried a few here. \n*Wolfgang Puck-Very good. The pizza we ordered here was great, Nice modern decor. Service was great as well\n*Pearl-Great! I love sushi, and they were awesome. Their fish was fresh and flavorful. They offered some nice sake choices as well. Very nicely designed interior and friendly service.\n*The grand wok-Eating healthy in vegas can be hard. TGW is a great healthy option thats quick and easy to grab. Everything is made to order and cooked on the spot. They offer a variety of meats and veggies to suite everyones taste.\n*Sugar factory-I have left a great 5 star review for the main SF. Although smaller, this SF is awesome as well.\n\nShopping-They offer a variety of little shops and boutiques here ranging from souvenirs to rolex. They have a women's boutique here that I absolutely love, but I am blanking on the name. It sells both high end and moderate priced clothing, shoes, and bags. They have a great selection and always seem to have a sale going on.\n\nShows-My boyfriend gambled his way to a comp show the first day we were staying here, so off to KA we went. I have been to many CDS shows in Vegas, and always loved them. KA was good, but not great. I would rate is a 4/5. I guess Le Reve still has my vote.\n\nNightlife-I used to enjoy MGM's nightlife, but as with all clubs they have their time. Although their clubs are still busy, they are not my goto places any longer. Crowds are not great, and they never really have any good talent. Bigger clubs like XS always have the big name dj's. However, i am very excited for Hakasan to open. I think this new spot will be an awesome addition to MGM and re-vamp their nightlife. You can't go wrong with Tiesto as a resident either.\n\nOverall I really like MGM and would recommend it. Nice clean rooms, great service, nice choice of restaurants, and good casino. Lastly at a moderate price, you can't go wrong.",1,0

I'm always torn between the taco salad and one of their chicken paninis. I'm not a vegan so I get regular chicken but they are able to make it vegan if you are. The food is very consistent and comes out every time hot and delicious. The staff is extremely friendly and the owner is always there checking on the customers. Make sure you save room for dessert because it can't be beat. Everything I've tried has been great but I always find myself picking the peanut butter brownie. Mmmm!,1,0
"Felt ill after eating here and my friend said maybe the food or cleanliness (or lack thereof)  made me ill, so I looked them up on the Maricopa County Restaurant site to see how they do on inspections.  PRETTY awful.  In fact, their last inspection said it was the 3rd CONSECUTIVE time inspectors found them keeping food at the wrong temperatures and that can make people sick.  Oh, and they also don't keep their sanitizer at proper levels so when they wipe surfaces, they just spread germs around.   YUK!

"Mandalay Bay does not disappoint.  Although I always stay at this hotel, this past weekend we tried one night at Mirage and 2 at MB - let me tell you we were excited to come back 'home' to Mandalay!  Even the smell they pump into the casino is amazing...plus the casino is large and well lit, not very smoky at all\n\nPros:  Great rooms (flat screen TV in the bathroom, the best bath products) perhaps the most comprehensive selection of restaurants from fine dining to casual middle of the night and need baked potato soup spots, THE BEST pool in Vegas - and the bars are rockin.  Don't have any hesitation to book here - there is a tram that will take you to the Tropicana/Las Vegas BLVD intersection and from there you can easily get anywhere else on the strip.\n\nCons:  the worst cocktail service in the casino\n\nOverall - a great choice (make sure you check their specials, you can get a very reasonable rate here!)",1,1

Nachos we shared were good, and the small order was more than enough for two of us.\n\nMy husband had the mixed fajitas, and enjoyed them.  Portion was huge, and we brought about half of it home. I had the pozole and Alex taco.  Both were flavorful.  Pozole had a nice amount of spice.  \n\nWe'll return.",1,0
This is based on the two times I TRIED to get sandwiches from them in the same week! First time was around 5pm and they had a sign that they ran out of bread and were closed.

Came in and really liked the decor. Decorated very festive. Chips were better than the salsa which was pretty runny. The guacamole was bland. My husband and I both ordered burritos. They were just ok. Nothing too spectacular and mine wasn't that hot. I did like their rice which was probably the best thing I had there.

The bartender completely ignored us for a good five minutes (no eye contact or anything) and one of the other bartenders from the other side asked if we had been helped yet and ended up getting us our beers. Then we were stuck with our guy again who took forever to take our order and was just non attentive. He was pretty enthralled in a conversation with a couple from Australia.

The good thing about this was that there is no line at all and you can be seated anywhere you want right away.  I settled with the Patio because that's always the way to go, even during the cold December weather.

The Duck Leg Confit was on their appetizer section and it was only $11 so I was assuming that it would be a little mini duck leg with some garnish.  Boy was I wrong about that when I got this huge platter presented in front of me with a nice big and crispy duck leg on top of a bed of lentils and port wine reduction.  It was amazing!  I almost decided to cancel out my Beef Bourgninon order because it was already a lot of food!\n\nDuck Leg Confit. This is an appetizer??

While this place isn't the most expensive source of entertainment for kids in the valley, nobody should be tossing their money away due to a lazy staff.\n\nThe bathrooms were messy, and the place had an overall dirty feeling to it.  When it came time to cash in the kids' tickets, we waited at the ticket counter for a good ten minutes before being helped.  Do you realize that they have prizes listed for 150,000 tickets?  Can you imagine having 150,000 tickets in a drawer somewhere in your house?  Ridiculous!!\n\nFor the money you'll waste here, you're better off doing something outside with the kids, ordering (or cooking) pizza, and then taking them to the toystore; it will be cheaper, healthier, and less mousey.",0,0
"The best car wash EVER!  When they say hand wash, it is hand wash.  No machines!!!  I spoke to the owner.  Very nice guy.  I told him this place will see me again and again.

"We went for sunday brunch , i like the fact they open at 7am, i figure everyone still sleeping nursing late night hangovers. I was right at 7 am only a handful of us old folks in line. . The buffet was very limited and not many items. For about 25 bucks a head you should get more. The hot foods were mostly breakfast items what happend to the lunch part of brunch. Very sad. Everthing was fresh as it should be since we were their early. Still can't believe a beautiful casino , ' upscale\"""" would have a brunch that was so simple.

"If you're looking for a 4 hour oil change this is the spot! Completely. Useless. Got there at noon for an oil change in our SUV, they didn't seem busy and the guy at the front was nice and helpful. We were quoted 30-45 min so decided to wait. 45 min later we got up to check on it - hadn't even started. We were then told that an employee called in so they were a bit behind, fine, I get that it happens. Communicate that though. Against my husband's better judgment we decided to wait it out and were told it'd be 45 min. We chose to take our other car to run some errands and were surprised over 2 hours later to get the call it was done. No discount. No coupon for future service. Nada.

"I stayed here for 3 nights while attending a conference and had a nice stay. The location was very convenient for walking to all of the places I needed to and also close to many restaurants and bars. The staff was friendly and very accommodating and upon checking in we received warm cookies, unexpected but nice. The breakfast buffet had a lot of options and nice quality food. The restaurant staff was also very friendly.\n\nThe room was spacious, the beds nice and being able to adjust the thermostat in-room was appreciated. Although the bathroom was nice and modern I thought it was odd that there was not a fan for ventilation and the glass half-door on the shower looked great (good water pressure too), but you couldn't really share the bathroom if you wanted to. I shared my hotel room with a friend attending the conference and I would have been fine with one of us brushing our teeth or whatever while the other one was showering but not with a glass door shower. \n\nFree Wi-fi,  free parking and free local shuttle were nice. \n\nUnfortunately I was not able to take advantage of the indoor pool or hot tub.",1,0
"Let's be fair.  I'm about 20 yrs older than the average age here.  So if you're mid 30s to early 40s and looking for a gay bar where you can hear tunes and drink...I don't think this is it.  Its huge and seems to have a regular clientele.  A good mix of girls and guys which is so different than the Chicago bar scene.  I do like that the house vodka was a brand name.  When we arrived there was a Tina Turner doing Proud Mary.  But then they grabbed people and it seems like it was a contest?  Its all in French.  We heard some good songs and the people from the crowd that was on stage all knew the dance moves.  I think the 2 big offenses for me was the back door where the smokers hang was left open so I got to enjoy all of the smoke floating in, and the bar tender spraying the crowd with water spontaneously.  We were dressed up coming from dinner and didn't want to be sprayed down.\nThis place is probably fun if you're in your 20s and attending college.",0,1
"If you're looking for an inexpensive drink option, you can get both a saki and beer combo for under $5.00.  \n\nSushi was okay; not great, but not terrible.

On both occasions, waited to get drinks, refills, and anything you may need after initial meal delivery.  Service is slow.\n\nWe sent a dish back this time and the server was pleasant and voided the cost of that dish.  We ended up getting something different and it was just okay!\n\nOne last note, where I'm from, they don't include wasabi in the sushi but instead only offer it on the side.  This place actually puts wasabi in the rice and or sushi ( we confirmed this with the waiter since I had never seen this done).  If you don't like wasabi, ask for them to leave it off the dish!",0,1
"Last night my honey and I went through our usual \""""what do you want for dinner?\"""" routine, where both of us try to avoid choosing. He said \""""Greek sounds great\"""", and I thought so too. So, I pulled out my trusty Yelp Android app, and we picked Posidon because of all the amazing reviews.\n\nWe were so excited to try a new place close to home, and it smelled quite good when we walked in. The waitress informed us it was her birthday, and that service might be a bit \""""slow\"""". No worries there, that was ok with us after a long day. \n\nWe ordered spanakopita as an appetizer, he ordered a gyro with no tomatoes and french fries, and I ordered the beef souvlaki sandwitch with Greek salad. \n\nLet me preface the food review with this: I LOVE food. I love going out to eat. I'm very forgiving of mistakes, and kind when I correct them. Out of my 56 Yelp reviews, only 4 have received 1 star, and all for a very legitimate reason. I really go out of my way to give places ample opportunities to correct my frustrations, and few places are lacking in their ability to make me happy. That said, on to the food. \n\nSpanakopita: It took awhile to come out, and it was not terribly appetizing to look at. The two pieces were drastically different in size, but that wasn't the worst part. The spanakopita was luke warm/cold, tasted like it came from the frozen food aisle or had been sitting out for weeks. It was bland, not at all flaky, and the texture was really weird. Oh, and the tzatziki sauce was the worst I've ever tasted, including the months past due grocery store kind that I kept in my fridge as a poor college student. The waitress didn't bother to come back and ask how it was.\n\nGyro with fries: The meat was flavorless, cold, and smothered in tomatoes (he specifically said to leave them out) and that terrible tzatziki sauce. The fries were cold and awful. HOW do you mess up fries???\n\nBeef souvlaki with salad: The beef was tougher than shoe leather, and the leather would have had more flavor. The tzatziki (yes, I'm saying it AGAIN just to emphasize) was TERRIBLE. Oh, and the salad. If you could even call it that. It came in a bowl with a fat blob of yucky dressing, close-to-gone onions & tomatoes, with 2 olives, no feta, and lettuce that looks like it had been trampled on by a herd of zebras.\n\nWe tasted each other's dinner to double check, talked quietly, and confirmed that it was the worst dinner (I told the waitress this in an apologetic tone) we'd ever had. The plates were thrown together like they didn't care, and the service was sub par.\n\nThe WORST Part: The waitress saw us not eating, came over and asked how dinner was. I politely said it was terrible, and started listing off our grievances. Then a woman, who was apparently the \""""boss lady\"""" came over to see what was wrong. I've never been so insulted in my life. When my bf said that the gyro meat was cold and bland, she said \""""well they cut it off the rotisserie and put it on the grill\"""". He politely told her that he knew that's how it worked, but that it wasn't hot. She said \""""Well, that doesn't make any sense. We're known for the best gyros in town, and we have 4 & 5 star reviews on Yelp\"""". Ok so we're totally making all this up, then. *scoff* She said \""""sorry\"""" and walked away. No offer to replace the food, or take a portion off our bill. \n\nSo we paid $22 for food we said was terrible, with nothing but a condescending apology to walk out of the door with. FYI, we paid for our food (we regret refusing to do so), and left all but 2 bites of each dinner on the table. \n\nI'd give the place another chance if the food were the only bad thing. But with that terrible service, I wouldn't step foot in there again if my life depended on it.",0,1
"Will not be going back to this store!!! If all best buys were like this one I would not shop there. The guy who helped us out, Arturo was awesome!! He was a lot of help. However the manger and supervisor (Stephen)  were anything but. We went in to trade in my iPad and buy a new one with a price match from target. They made us jump thru hoops to get the price match. We checked to make sure target had it in stock before we went in. Arturo was told by his manger they called one store that was across the street without us by them to see what store they called. We then had to pull up it online then give them the number to call. We waited around forever. Then the computer broke at check out and again it took the same supervisor to come over to help us. Arturo talked to us and tried to get Stephen to come over. Took forever!!! He is obviously  not worried about customer service. I understand they need to make sure it's in stock but come talk to us. Don't come over with an attitude because you don't want to price match.",0,1

"Best use of a dollar in Vegas. \n\nThese machines are set up to play for fun, unlike so many that I grew up playing.  The magnets are set to keep you playing, and almost every game gives you the full five ball run.  Replay games are at an attainable level, and it is clear to me the owner loves the game and wants more people to love it too.\n\nWhen I go to Vegas I always take time away from all the flashing lights to go look at more flashing lights!  This place lets me touch real quarters too!  The drive off strip helps keep this place from getting too busy, so it is always a great experience,  When you can not only see some of the rarest games from the past and present but play them you know you have a winner.\n\nIf you grew up playing pinball you will have a hard time spending twenty bucks here. You can play one game for a long time if you are a pinball wizard.  If you have kids this is a safe venue to bring them, and they have good popcorn for a quarter.\n\nIf a machine is not working quite right, the staff seems like they want to know.  All of the machines are in such great shape it amazes me. These are not tired old cast off machines.\n\nMachines from the 40's can be played here.  My favorite is the Circus game that was built in a cabinet that looks like a pac man machine - but it is a pinball machine.  It is one of only two ever made!  Many of the machines have an historical slant that most collectors would keep away from the public.  The Circus is the highest priced machine there at one dollar a play - everything else is priced low and even the new machines like Iron Man allow you to buy multiple games for less than the one game price. ( One game 75 cents, 3 plays for $2)\n\nGo have some real fun to add to your reel fun!",1,1
"Montevida was a decent place to live for the year we were there. It became more inconvenient to get in and out as the light rail construction ramped up. The office staff had a \""""Can I help you?\"""" type of attitude as soon as the lease was signed as oppose to the \""""How may I help?\"""" they treat you with when trying to lure you in. The maintenance was okay. They usually had a quick fix approach as oppose to fully solving the problem. The apartment layout was nice and unique, spacious closets, nice bathroom. \n\nMy BIGGEST complaint was how they advised me to have the carpet professionally cleaned when we moved out, so that they would not include this as deduction from our security deposit refund.  After turning it a signed receipt from the cleaning company (as requested), they have failed to remove this as deduction. After multiple visits and six months later, they have failed to refund this.",0,0

"Stumbled upon Zucca one night when walking over to the Traverse. At the time, the boy and I looked at the menu, looked at each other and promptly decided 'Valentines'. The menu had plenty options for meat, fish and vegetarian eaters alike, it was hard to pick really what I wanted to try first!\n\nFor Valentines itself, there was a set menu for 28 quid (3 courses). This little cafe/restaurant had their delivery down pat. Although clearly preprepared, the food was of such high quality you could forgive them for working round what is such a high turnover night for restaurants. The waiting staff (or at least the lady who served us) were discreet, and efficient, allowing us time between courses to pause but not to start to wander. \n\nTo the meal: as we sat down, my eye was immediately drawn to the table arrangement. Now, I don't normally comment, but on the table was a little tray of salt, pepper and oil with just the smallest dab of balsamic vinegar. It almost looked like a work of art in itself to match the flower arrangement and candle. \n\nAs it was Valentines day, I treated myself as the non driver of the night to a Valentines cocktail, a martini-based strawberry infused concoction, with (I swear) a hint of herb - basil? Might have imagined it, but it was a delicious aperitif to start the evening. I followed it up with a large glass of Nero D'Avolo, more of an acquired taste, which arrived the further I travelled down the glass. The boy tucked into a rose prosecco, which was like a trail of bubbly lava going down the throat. \n\nTo the food - for starters, I had roasted Mediterranean vegetables with rocket while the boy had wild mushroom tart. I think this was the only time I felt a pang of regret for the preparation style as the vegetables were refrigerator-cold, where I expected them to be even a little warm still. Nonetheless, great texture, great flavour, and the mushroom tart tasted lovely as well, although the pastry was a little hard for the boys taste (re-warmed, we suspected). \n\nWe also tucked into warm rosemary foccacia (oh, so, so rosemary good, I haven't eaten bread this delicious in a while) and olives while we waited for our starter and took the opportunity to mop up olive soaked oil as well as the balsamic-dipped oil that had so caught my eye earlier. \n\nAnyway, back to the main course, where I had a beautifully cooked piece of salmon, resting on top of a spring onion potato cake (you know that goosebump feeling you get when you tuck into slowly cooked, caramelised onions - well, this one would have had you at your knees) and sauteed spinach surrounded by a lake of creamy herb sauce. The boy had ribeye steak in a green peppercorn sauce that in his words, melted in the mouth and he had never had a steak cooked so well. My my, strong words, but I believed him. A side of garlic foccacia bread had us stuffed to the gunnels, but in such a satisfied way.\n\nFinally, we both had the passionfruit sorbet as a light finish to a sumptious meal. I was expecting something sweet, but this sorbet was sharp as they come and super, super cold, having also been pre-prepared (frozen strawberries at the bottom were a giveaway). Doused with prosecco, it was a welcome accompaniment to the sharp sorbet.\n\nSo in summary, Zucca, you are sharp as they come. Highly recommended and definitely glad we chose you for our meal last night.",1,1

The Dogg says. Muy bien Manuel's.  It's the Sonoran style type of comida Mexicano that is prevalent in AZ.   My taco was full of shredded beef and had good flavor. It was also stuffed full of lettuce tomato onions and cheese. My tostada was very crispy the beans tasted homemade and was one of the best tostadas I've ever had. Manuel's has one of the most tastiest salsas in the state. You can actually get full eating just chips and salsa with a beer and use your dinner as a partial appetizer and lunch for the next day. I miss the 32nd St. and Indian school location! But this one on 28th street has also been very good. Great service. Good food for the money.

"I signed up for the \""""Black Card\"""" membership ($20/month) over a year ago and was fairly pleased with the experience of working out here. While the service isn't *exceptional*, the price is right and everything is well maintained. I'm sure the \""""Black Card\"""" membership is perfect for many customers (tanning and aqua massages included, plus free guest daily), I found I wasn't using the additional services. I don't tan or use the massage tables and I rarely bring people with me to work out. But I made a one year comitment to the higher price, which was fine. That was my choice and I can live with cost. The problem came when I tried to downgrade to the $10/month option after my year commitment ended. The gentlman I spoke with told me that I would have to pay a $50 \""""activation fee\"""" (which was waived when I opted for the year commitment). An \""""activation fee\"""" after having been a member for 14 months? That's sort of insane after also paying a $40 membership fee each year. When you add in the cost of activation fee and membership fee, I've been paying approximately $28/month. There are plenty of options for health clubs in the $30 range that will even include pools & fitness classes (zumba, yoga, spin, etc.), which Planet Fitness does not offer. \n\nAgain, I think there are many customers who can benefit from the black card membership. I'm simply saying that I don't think it is asking too much that someone who fulfilled the terms of their commitment not be taken advantage of when they are trying to continue their membership at a price that fits his/her needs.",0,1

And he doesn't say anything. He comes back 2 minutes later and say excuse me and then nearly smack me in the head trying to get by again. I ask him to come over and he ignores me.  Then he starts getting loud and says I'm going to call the manager. Was really not sure what he was threatening me with.

The drinks are expensive but good and they come in a P&T cup. The show is not for those wanting cheap and cheesy Las Vegas magic. The show is intelligent with a touch of politics and social commentary added in. Getting photos and autographs after is amazing.,1,1
"We have been coming here since they opened and have yet to have bad food or service!  Great little place to go, upscale food with prices that make sense for the quality of the food you get.  Usually get the same server (wish I could remember names ) who is awesome!  Highly recommend this place.",1,1
"This past Tuesday I was staying at the M Resort out in \""""who knows where\"""" off the strip.  My colleagues and I had a 6am flight home.   I was not confident the hotel would have a taxi at 4:15am when we needed it.  So I did a search on Yelp and found United Car Service.  I filled out the \""""contact us\"""" section on their website requesting a quote for large SUV to the airport for 4:15am the next morning.  I received an email back from Joe Zane within minutes providing a very reasonable quote.  I responded/confirmed  and received an letting me the driver's name was David and that everything was set.  At 4:10am Wednesday I received a text from David letting me know he was waiting for us downstairs.  A black Cadillac Escalade ESV awaited and took me and my colleagues to the airport in quiet comfort.  Amazing service.  Easily arranged at the last possible moment. A very happy customer.",1,1
"I've been a few more times since my initial review, and they seem to have he service kinks worked out.  In addition, the vibe seems to be 'working' much better.  I've upgraded my review to reflect this.  PastaBAR is now my favorite downtown restaurant!",1,1
"A great place to kickstart your night. Head up to the bar, order a 190 octane (extra shot of everclear on top, of course) and for $10, you're good to ride. \n\nIt's a ritual in Vegas for me, I'd suggest you start doing it, too. Watch out for the bran freeze.",1,1

What an excellent find!  Went there for breakfast with 3 others.  All our choices were good but the pancakes were awesome!  Light and flavorful. And they served them with a big pitcher of syrup instead of the usual mini thimble portion most restaurants serve that disappear after the first bite.  Never had to wait for coffee refills.  Our waitress was very attentive and we even got a visit from the owner who visited each table to make sure everything was top notch.  Good job you guys!  We'll be back!  \nP & friends,1,1
"This is a awesome structure. 40 stories up and 360 view of the city. Great staff that is knowledgeable about the city, history and great recommendations for stuff throughout the city.

Wow if I could give this place a big fat 0 I would. HORRIBLE. They were out of some of the bread for their sandwiches. Imagine a bakery that is out of bread. We also ordered their featured seasonal soup. Guess what? They were out of it.  Food not worth the price. Don't go.,0,0
I don't know what was going on this Saturday but the food has taken a turn for the worse at C4. There was a Horse charity event taking place at the stage out the back but this was no excuse for the food we received there last night.

It was very quiet also and I don't know if this is a reflection of the food or what. The service was very good.,0,0

All and all won't recommend to anyone.,0,0
"I went here during the middle of the day this past weekend, NOT at night, so I can't comment on how it is as a club.  Upon entering we were given a tour of the place, which I recommend to anyone stopping by.  After being awed, we chilled at the outdoor area.\n\nIt was a great place to kick back and chill, and it had a nice view of the strip.  The drink menu was over the top, and one of my friends got really buzzed thanks to the bartender messing up the drink order and making an extra martini (I was surprised that they actually gave the extra drink to us).  However, be sure to watch your tab; they automatically tagged on a 20% tip to my friend's bill without him noticing.\n\nWe weren't here late at night or during any huge games, but I highly recommend it as a stop to kick back and enjoy a few drinks away from the smoke and flashing lights of Vegas.\n\nFor a few moments, at least.",1,1
"Good food & great view. My husband and I went to the Eiffel Tower to celebrate our anniversary. Although we enjoyed the food, he had the beef Wellington, & I had the short ribs, I honestly thought it could have been better for what it cost.  The short ribs were a little dry.\n\nThe best thing about the meals: dessert. I had the chocolate souffl\u00e9, & my husband had the pistachio. They were both great. Yummy!\n\nIt's worth going for the experience, but I wouldn't go back again.",1,0
Picked up a couple $49 doorbuster nightstands on Black Friday.  Really nice units that'd otherwise be more than $100.   They have a lot of great furniture here.  I especially like the kids split-level bunk beds and the coffee tables with rising tops.,1,1
"My prior homestead of 11 years was located directly behind Senor Tequila, which has been in this small shopping center off of Rea Rd long before Trader Joe's and the yoga pants crowd took it over, and I used to eat there semi-regularly, always enjoying all that they had to offer.  I had not been for several years and decided to stop here for dinner on the way home tonight.  I was thoroughly unimpressed, which made me a little sad.\n\nComing right after work, I got there around 5:30 ish on a Monday night.  There was a gentleman sitting at the bar and 2 other tables were seated.  I was instantly greeted by a young man who promptly seated me, he turned out to be my server and was very nice, attentive without hovering, but I expected that since the place was basically empty.  I had not eaten here since before they expanded - the seating area is clean and well decorated, and the tables are nicely spaced instead of being slammed on top of each other.  \n\nThe food was by no means bad at all - the flavors were fresh, well presented - there was nothing offensive about anything, it just wasn't anything special.  \n\nThe food:\nTortilla chips - may have been fresh but I didn't think they were particularly tasty.\nSalsa - tomatoes, onions and cilantro.  Tasted fresh, which was nice, but nothing special.  No real oomph. \nQueso - for almost $6, I was expecting cheese dip so good that my toes curled.  Oddly served in a metal lidded bowl, it was fine.  Nothing particularly wrong with it, just fine.  \nShredded beef chimichangas w/ rice and beans $13:  The rice was a little hard and tasteless.  The beans were very smooth and served in a small fried tortilla cup - I did not care for these at all.  I was served two thin chimichangas cut on the diagonal for 4 pieces, with a small amount of queso and a small amount of tomatoes and onions sprinkled on the top.  Again, they tasted fine, but nothing special.  \n\nEverything was a resounding meh.  I have always enjoyed Senor Tequila and maybe I just ordered the wrong thing tonight.  For the cheese dip, chimichangas and a soft drink, my total was $23, not including the tip.  I won't be rushing back, preferring to go to Azteca... or even *wince* On the Border (eek!).",0,1
"It's a below average, overpriced Chinese buffet.  Crab legs were overdone, stir-fry dishes all had a strange taste.

"Got the Woojito at happy hour.  It was terrible.  Tasted like old lemonage.  Shame on me for expecting a good mixed drink at a sushi place but it was like 100 degrees and I just wanted a mojito.\n\nThe rolls were pretty solid but we ordered salmon roe w/ a quail egg on top and when it came out, the yolks of the quail egg were solid.  It was really gross.  We sent them back and it took about 30 minutes to get a new batch.  The new batch at least had normal yolks but still tasted a bit funky.  The waitress didn't really ever show any concern even when we told her the second batch was bad.  Instead, she just dropped off our check with the full charge on it.  At that point, we told her that the eggs needed to come off.  She took the check to her manager and came back and took one of three salmon roes off and two of six quail eggs off \""""since we had eaten some\"""".  Are you freaking kidding me?  We had to eat it to know it was bad!  \n\nWe paid for our meal because we just wanted to get out of there but I couldn't let it go so I asked to see the manager.  When the manager came out, she seemed a bit concerned and offered to refund the rest of the eggs/roe.  That was ok, but all in all, I felt like the staff could have been more sympathetic and accommodating.  (Sorry, have to cut this review short as I have to go to my jousting tournament).",0,0

Our bill was $45...they don't give change and you can't use balance for a tip.  So to not lose out we only used one $25 gift card. We have to go back now. And no the gift certificates were not purchased at a discount. \n\nAnyways, bottom line we used to love this place, but this new owner had really ruined the whole concept. :(",0,0

"My first review for this restaurant, although I've been eating here for the past 2-3 years. They took over from an Italian chain. When they first opened, everything was cool: attentive, friendly, even enthusiastic servers, good food and beer, good prices. Gradually, it appears that the managers/staff who originally opened the place have moved on. The result has been (in general) inconsistent service and food. \n\nThere are still a couple of great servers there, and if you get one of them, you'll have a pleasant experience. This past week, I ordered a chicken burrito for part of my meal; the burrito itself was fine but the sauce tasted disconcertingly like Ragu spaghetti sauce. (it should be noted, though, that they have the best salsa in town that I've found so far!) To top off the general decline, they raised their prices a couple of months ago.  As time passes, I'm finding fewer and fewer reasons to go back. Aside from hiring more enthusiastic servers, the one thing they could do to get back on track would be to get a little inventive with the menu. There's really nothing there that's different from any other Mexican restaurant in town, and what is different does not taste distinctive. How about getting back to basics -- street tacos, tortas, tlayudas, tostados?",0,1
"DO NOT EAT HERE! This was the worst dining experience I've had in my life. The food took over a half hour, and it was cold when we got it.

What a jerk!  $12 for a burger patty with a slice of cheese and bread with no fries. This place is not even worth looking at the menu.",0,0
"Came in for a haircut and shave. Was there when they opened and had no wait. I like it like that. I have had face shaved at other places and must say I would rather go back to those places. My haircut was nothing special. Actually have gotten better haircuts from the hackers at Great Clips. The face shave though was worse. Yes, he went through the motions with the hot towel and menthol rub, but I was not impressed with the shave. When it was all said and done $47.00 later, I went to my truck to get a good look at my face and beard. The beard looks good but my neck had literally 20 little cuts on it that had been,or were still bleeding!! Are you kidding me?! I have NEVER had such a $hitty shave. Lesson learned. I will not be back!",0,0
"I really wanted to like this salon.  It has a cool concept with the art work and the tattoo artists that are there.  It is in a cute spot!  I just did not have the best experience.  I went in to donate my hair for locks of love.  I found this place by a google search for places who are familiar with the donation.  Julie booked my appointment and even changed my time to later because of work! Excellent right?  Yes, so far I was off to a good start.  I had measured my hair length the night before and figured 10 inches would be right at my shoulder blades.  When I sat  down in the chair with Julie we discussed my hair style, I even showed her pictures of a couple styles I liked.  She then informed me that she did not have a tape measure.  Her co-worker offered her a comb that had a ruler. Great we measured what we not agreed on 10 inches.  Her co-worker then says, well cut above the pony tail holder.  I could not see where the pony tail holder was in relation to the measure line.  Julie then started to cut...OMG it was three inches below my ears.  Oh god!  It was not like I could glue my hair back on.  She then proceeded with the color.  Meh.  It was all over dark brown, I had some highlights in the front, she said they might show through but they showed through REALLY bad!  The next day at work under the fluorescent lights it was really pronounced.  So now onto the cut.  I had told Julie that  I had wanted to make sure my hair could go into a pony tai.  She had mentioned an angled bob.  I told her I had that style in the past and did not want it again because it was a pain to grow back out.  Well, like the pony tail cutting process, she went ahead and cut it the way SHE wanted it.  The hair on the very back of my head is about two inches long ;(  I paid her the $70 for the cut and color and even tipped her $20 but I will not be back.  I went home and measured my pony tail and it was 15 inches.  How does 10 inches off turn into 15... that is such a huge difference.  I really wish that I had been listened to when having such a personal thing as having that much hair cut off.  \nLike I said I did really want to like this place but I just did not have that great of experience....",0,1
"I have deleted my previous 4 star review of this salon.  After going here for couple of months i have seen a huge decline in quality of treatment.  My gel manicure didn't even last the night, tho Kevin (the owner) did fix them again, that is after he was defensive and blamed me for using \""""chemicals\"""" on my nails. Even after my re-do my gels only lasted one week before they started chipping.  At this point I'm done going back again to have things fixed that should have been done correctly the first time.  I give the salon itself a 4star  it is very clean, tho i guess it should be since the owner, kevin thought it was more important to clean then to finish my manicure he had started.  In the short time i have gone there two other tech's have already quit, the two remaining are super sweet but very new and inexperienced in their fields.  I don't have a problem with people 'training' on me but don't expect me to pay top dollar for my treatment.

"Mom and pop shop. Hole in the wall. Locally owned. Take your pick. Actually all three apply. Before my initial thoughts, here's the back story.\n\nAfter speaking with the owner Mike and the nice server Celeste, I found out that this place is an actual truck stop/wash. They decided to start serving breakfast and lunch because of all the numerous truckers coming in complaining about eating fast food at the McDonald's on the corner.\n\nSo SNS Diner (SNS stands for Southern Nevada Services) was born. They have been open for about a year. They are located off of Colton but the main cross street is Losee Road. As soon as you turn on to Colton, the place is on your right. Just look for the barbeque signs. At first look you might think that this place could be where they would film a CSI episode. But after coming out of your car, the smell of would smoke (hickory maybe? I should of asked) should tell you that there is some good smoking going on and im not talking about weed.\n\nNow for main reasons why you should go here: The good food and great service.\n\nFor breakfast I have had the Biscuits and Gravy ($6.99), Pastrami Hash ($8.99), Eggs Benedict ($8.99), and 2 Eggs over easy with Bacon and Potatoes (6.99).\n\nThe Biscuits and Gravy came highly recommended so that was the first item my wife was looking forward to. The gravy itself has breakfast sausage mixed in it and had a little bit of a kick to it. After taking one bite you will know that the biscuits were made fresh from scratch.\n\nThe Pastrami Hash was just a tad bit salty but with a bit of ketchup or barbeque sauce it rounds out the flavor. I can only assume the bit of saltiness is from the chopped up bits of pastrami. With that it is comprised of green peppers, onions, scrambled eggs, and black pepper. It it topped off with 2 fried eggs cooked to your liking.\n\nThe Eggs Benedict were decent. They were definitely better than the ones I had a couple weeks ago at another breakfast joint.\n\nThe 2 eggs and bacon with home fries were just average.\n\n\n\nFor lunch, (this is where they will definitely keep me coming back) I have had the 3 Meat Combo ($13.99) and the Rib Tip Sandwich ($8.50).\n\nThe 3 Meat Combo you have your choice of ribs, chicken, brisket, or pulled pork, all which have been smoked for whatever designated time they did it for. I went with ribs, brisket, and pulled pork. The St Louis Ribs have this rub on it that makes it very flavorful. It's not fall off the bone tender but tender enough for you to eat it off the bone with ease. The Brisket was juicy and tender as well. The Pulled Pork was good too. The common theme for all these meats is that they all have the great smoke flavoring and are not dry at all as evidenced by the juices at the bottom of your foil lining of your basket.\n\nThe Rib Tip Sandwich originally I thought it said Tri Tip so when I got my sandwich I was surprised to see that the chopped bits of meat were actually rib tips. Nevertheless it was good. So good in fact that I didnt even need the bread just to eat the meat! Dont get me wrong, the bread was good too! It was all buttered up and grilled to a slight crispiness on the inner portion. the rib tips also had a mixture of some kind of rub that has a kick to it. The plate comes with Carolina Mustard and a Vinaigrette Slaw that is usually in the sandwich but they will ask you if you want it on the side instead of inside the sandwich. Both plates come with your choice of one side which consists of Mac n Cheese, Smoked Beans, Smoked Beans and Rice, Green Salad, Vinaigrette Slaw, or Potato Salad. All are good choices.\n\nService is excellent! Celeste constantly walks around making sure you are ok. Sometimes Mike the owner will stop by and confirm that everything was ok.\n\nSome random info: Business hours are Monday thru friday 7 am to 4 pm and Saturday 7 am to 2 pm. Closed Sundays. Breakfast hours are until 10 am. You can only order breakfast. After 10 lunch items only. They take cards.\n\nIn closing, I say give this place a chance. Even though it is kind of in a hidden spot, you will definitely remember where they are once you eat here! I know the hours dont extend into the dinner slot but you gotta remember, this place was originally for truckers making their way through town during the day. Im sure once they start getting busier the owner will have to do something about it, which was pretty much my last comment right before I left. Also I keep wanting to try their berry cobbler which other Yelpers have mentioned but I always find myself too full to order it! \n\nYelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #194",1,1

"My wife and I decided to try Il Vino Cucina and Wine Bar at Aliante Station for dinner tonight. We had been to the previous occupant of the space, Pips, once about a year and a half ago. It was good, but the prices never got us back in. After trying Il Vino, I can tell you we will definitely be back.\n\nWe started with their Antipasti Appetizer. The fried zucchini was good if you dipped it in the included marinara sauce, but otherwise had limited flavor. The bruschetta was yummy, but the fried mozzerella was OMG good. It was still creamy and yummy even though it wasn't flaming hot, like you see in most restaurants. \n\nMy wife had the Chicken Cannelloni. The flavor was good, but my wife found it a little dry for her taste, almost like it needed a little more sauce inside the shells. I had the chicken parm. So good. I know it's hard to screw up, but the chicken was well-seasoned and moist. The marinara sauce was amazingly good.\n\nHaley, the General Manager stopped by to say hi, and we couldn't resist chatting with her. She was very open to feedback. There are a couple of kinks they are working out (some of the Italian sodas on their menu they don't actually carry), but otherwise, it was a good dinner.\n\nThe prices were more than reasonable and portions were adequate, but not obscene. This could very easily become a solid neighborhood Italian restaurant in an area that is underserved.",1,1

"Went in for a brake change and an hour later I received a phone call stating I needed $650 worth of work done on everything from the calipers, to break fluid, hardware...you name it. I'm not apposed to paying for things I need, but these guys have that terrible used car salesman approach. They make it sound like your car is falling apart just to make their numbers. I'm sure it costs them a pretty penny to carry the Just Brakes name and in the end they'll end up loosing their rights to the name due to customer service. Because the name just gets them in the door...The personal service and how you are treated and communicate with your customers is what keeps you in business. Couldn't take them serious on what I ACTUALLY needed...Cars need a lot of things, and sometimes that does include extensive repairs, but my car is a 2007 that has been maintained per the dealership recommendation from day one. After speaking with the third person at this location, I decided to move on. The great thing is that I found a much better shop using reviews on Yelp, a locally owned location yet very clean an modern by design. Took it in the same day and the customer service alone was 100 times better. They told me that nothing seemed like it was in urgent need of repairs, but even if they had found something the customer service alone was enough for me to trust them. Very straight forward and treated you like a person. I asked them to do a brake flush since I was already there and they were able to get it done and have me on my way much faster than expected. Plus the prices were more reasonable and now I have a new trusted adviser. PS - this is only my 2nd negative review online in my life..Easy going guy that felt strongly about my experience",0,0
